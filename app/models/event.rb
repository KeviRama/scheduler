  #  This is a method to assist with the display of events which span more
  #  than two days, but which aren't flagged as being all_day.  That is,
  #  they might start at 09:00 on Monday and end at 15:00 on Friday.  Arguably
  #  such events have probably been entered into the calendar wrongly, and
  #  would be better entered as a recurring event, rather than as one long
  #  one, but they still display rather strangely.  By default, FullCalendar
  #  shows them as a continuous stripe, running through all the intermediate
  #  days and cluttering up the display.  I feel they would better shown
  #  with their actual start and finish times on the first and last days,
  #  but as if they were all_day events on all the intermediate days.
  #
  #  Note that this method will create 3 new events for each such event,
  #  but they don't get saved to the database.  They thus don't need to
  #  pass validation.
