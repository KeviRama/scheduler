<p>The following event(s) have resources requested for them which are
flagged as needing corresponding staff - e.g. drivers for mini-buses.</p>

<p>Please could you edit your event(s) and attach the relevant staff
to the event.  This will aid in the allocation of suitable resources
(e.g. the right size of mini-bus).</p>

<%= render @items %>

<p>If you would prefer not to receive these messages, you can disable them
by editing your user record in Scheduler.  Log in and then click on your
