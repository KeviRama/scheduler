# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  name: "Service 1"
  current: true
  add_directly: true

two:
  name: "Service 2"
  current: true
  add_directly: true
