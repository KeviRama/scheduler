# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

#
#  I'm not totally happy with this.  These would normally be created
#  as part of system installation by a function in the UserProfile
#  model.  The existence of these is a pre-requisite for a functioning
#  Scheduler installation.
#
#  I've yet to find a good way to run that function as part of setup
#  for the tests, so I'm using some fixtures instead.  For these
#  particular items, fixtures are more appropriate than factories.
#
#  It is necessary to keep the values here in step with those set
#  by the UserProfile model.
