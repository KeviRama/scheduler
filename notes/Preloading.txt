====== Preloading ======
Created Monday 11 August 2014


Rails's ActiveRecord provides various ways of preloading associated models for efficiency.  The three ways of doing it are:

* includes
* preload
* eager_load

and it's not immediately obvious how they differ.  There's a useful explanation at: 

http://blog.arkency.com/2013/12/rails4-preloading/

but what it boils down to is:

* preload always does two separate queries
* eager_load crams everything into one query
* includes decides which of the two to use dynamically

It gets more interesting when your selection criteria also depend on other records - then you will want to use //joins// or //references// as additional modifiers.  See the above mentioned web page for a longer discussion on how to make sure you get the records you want, although this hasn't affected me yet.
