====== Tuesday 13 Oct 2015 ======

I have started today by pushing my new find_free facility to the live system.  Next I intend to:

[*] Modify all autocomplete fields to select the first item - consistency
[*] Fix the import script to classify PS periods and suspend them when appropriate
[ ] Enhance my find_free stuff to do more and have a prettier interface

Need a current copy of the live database with which to test things, since its format has just changed.
