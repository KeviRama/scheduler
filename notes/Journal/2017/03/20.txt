Things to add today:

[*] Filter by when the commitment was last updated
[*] Daily and weekly batch jobs
[*] Make sure my staging server does not send actual e-mails.

Just discovered that the existing commitments in my database have no updated_at or created_at field!  Ow!  I fear I need that field if I'm going to keep track of which ones have been notified and which haven't.

I've added the fields, but all the existing records have nil values.  This may be OK, but I'll need to be aware of it.  I could potentially add a job to fill them all in.
