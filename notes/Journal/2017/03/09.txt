Did a group for the invigilators plus a quantity as configuration items.  Now let's add in some extra information about our candidates.

* Who has been freed up from a lesson
* How many invigilations so far today
* How many invigilations so far this week

(That's not "in the week so far" - it's "how many have so far been allocated for the current week".)

I think I need to wrap my candidates' models up in another model which carries the extra information.

What I'm assembling at the moment is an array of candidates, the type of which happens to be an arbitrary structure, so far containing an element id and an element name.  Need to make that structure a bit more formal.  Good to see that I can send an array of an arbitrary structure though.

So - add a boolean to show who has been freed from a lesson.  Need to start by finding all the suspended lessons.

Need an up to date copy of the school's data with the 4th year lesson suspensions in.
