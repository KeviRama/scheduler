An algorithm to find and sort available staff for Invigilation.  Not quite as bullet proof as the existing free finder, but possibly faster.

* Find all events (suspended or not) which overlap the indicated time - pre-load their commitments.
* Find all the staff who might be up for use - pre-load their elements.
* Separate the events into suspended and not.
* Iterate through the un-suspended events, subtracting any elements which they use.
* We now have a list of free staff.
* Iterate through the suspended lessons (not any other suspended events) to find the staff who have been freed up.

What this will fail to pick up are the staff who are busy by being a member of a group.  We're not doing a proper iterative descent through groups.  Will deal with all lessons though, and staff are seldom allocated to events by group (but not never).

Does the existing free-finder indicate someone as being free if their lesson has been covered?  I believe not, although there does exist a scope for selecting un-covered commitments, I don't seem to be using it.  Has it ever been used?  And tested?

What algorithm does it use?
