Looking at producing some documentation for the exams stuff, as part of my on-line documentation.  This in turn requires that the demo system has that code (it does) and has some space in which to do exams.  It also needs all the preliminary items there, like event categories, properties, event sources etc.  This is a good opportunity to make sure I have a list of those.

Note that I'm not intending to enter any invigilation via the seeds file - I'll do that through the UI as part of the documentation - but I need the supporting items and some suspended lessons in order to do it.

What things need to pre-exist so that the exams component will work?  What gets linked to the records as they are created?  Review the source.

Exam templates (actually called rota_templates).  Nothing
Rota slots.  Likewise nothing.
Exam cycles. Likewise nothing.

Must be the proto_things which need them.

Need:

[*] Eventcategory - Invigilation
[*] Eventsource - RotaSlot
[*] Property - Invigilation

All those could be created as part of the seeding process, plus we could do to set up a group called "Teaching staff".  The first three want to be done on every system, and the last one only on my demo system.

The eventcategory Invigilation is already there.  And actually, I have a group called "All staff" which will do as a starting point for invigilators.

Just check the seeding process runs successfully.  Then I'll add some 5th year lessons on the Monday of the following week.  Just copies of the previous week, but suspend them so that we can see some freed up staff.  And do I have suitable rooms to use?
