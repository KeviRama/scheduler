Ready to think about implementing the actual drag-n-drop bit.  I think this should make a PUT request on the Request record.  From the point of view of the client it is modifying the Request record (hence a PUT and not a POST) even though the way it is implemented at the back end is by the creation of a new record.

Something like:

PUT http://localhost/requests/N/fulfill?eid=NN

I can either implement it as a method in the requests controller, or as a separate controller.  I think the former is more logical.

Each of my list items on the right needs to be draggable.

I could perhaps add an exception event to the FreeFinder model.  One could then search for elements which are free //except// for being involved in that particular event.  That way I could get a list of everyone who would be free if they weren't already down to invigilate this event.

Drag-n-drop seems to be too problematic.  I'm going to go with a double click on the item to select it and move it over.  I was struggling there because double click was also selecting the text, but I've discovered a jQuery call disableSelection(); which seems to prevent that.

Onward - don't get distracted.

Basic addition is now working.  Things on the immediate list to add.

[ ] Remove them from the candidates list as they are added.  (Re-work candidate selection)
[ ] Allow them to be removed from the list of nominees (back to candidates)
[ ] Visual indication of events needing nominees - incompleteness.
[ ] Make the predictive text box work too.
[ ] Auto-increment quantity if more are added.
[ ] Prevent quantity being reduced to fewer than allocated.
