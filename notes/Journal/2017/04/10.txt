Thought I was ready to start testing but then realised I still want to let the number of invigilators be changed.  I propose to let it happen as follows:

If the user changes the number of invigilators in the proto_event and regenerates events, then the number on each event will be updated provided:

* The existing number isn't 0
* There are no staff allocated to the event

This pair of conditions implies that the individual event is not as yet modified from what it was before.

It also occurred to me that I should not reduce the quantity below that currently allocated, but given the requirement above that the current allocation be 0, that won't arise.

Let's try deleting all of Ian's invigilation and doing it again, better.  Test sending of e-mails too - both manual and automated.  Done all that.
