OK - I've written up some documentation on my proposed new models - [[:Models:ProtoEvent|ProtoEvent]] , [[Models:ProtoCommitment|ProtoCommitment]] and [[:models:ProtoRequest|ProtoRequest]] 

What ICF will see as a room record, will in fact be a [[:Models:ProtoEvent|ProtoEvent]] .  All he will specify is a room and some dates - the rest will be hard coded.  Do I have enough to create the new database records?  I have currently specified only a subset of what en [[:Models:Event|Event]] has, but I'd rather err on the side of needing to add some later, rather than having fields which end up never being used.

Let's bite the bullet and create it.

And immediately I realise that I've missed something.  I'm linking my [[:Models:ProtoEvent|ProtoEvent]] records to my [[:Models:ExamCycle|ExamCycle]] record, so there needs to be another ID field.  Perhaps make this a polymorphic relationship so that [[:Models:ProtoEvent|ProtoEvent]] records can be linked to other things too.  Call it the "generator", or the "owner"?  Owner might be confused with a person.  How about "owner_record"?

Likewise, it needs to link to a rota template, so that real events can be generated later.
