====== Monday 06 Feb 2017 ======

OK - today I try to get the editing of exam cycles - and specifically of [[:Models:ProtoEvent|ProtoEvent]] records within those cycles - up and running.  I'm going to use a template and Backbone within the page, and then requests to create and edit the actual records will be done with reference to the parent [[:Models:ExamCycle|ExamCycle]] record.

What states can a proto event row be in?

Creating		Down at the bottom.  Never changes from this state.
Created		Has been created, but not yet done any generation.
Generated	Has been generated and has events.
Editing		In the middle of editing it.

Possibly more to come.
