Distinct progress over the weekend and yesterday.  Nearly have the splits working, and using a new view too.  Next things to do:

[*] Finish off splits through the GUI
[*] Add Request records to the d/b
[*] Make Requests propagate correctly when the events are built
[*] Make sure they're transferred correctly on a split.
[*] Add an "Invigilation" property (like "Cover") to help with event filtering.

And then we can start thinking about the UI for adjusting and fulfilling requests.

Having a bit of difficulty getting Backbone to work with a dynamic dialogue box.  I don't think I've got my ideas quite right.

I'm currently just adding HTML to an existing DOM element.  I think what I need to do instead is create a new DOM element (for which Backbone will do most of the work) and then inject that element into a visible component.  Still not sure quite what's going on, but it would appear that an element can exist separate from the visible DOM, and then be injected, but still be the same element.  Try it and see.

Yes, I think the problem is this - I am rendering HTML into the parent element.  What I should be doing is rendering HTML into my view's $el, then shoving that into the parent element.

Yes, that does seem to be working correctly.  Not sure how the properties get carried over, but they seem to.
