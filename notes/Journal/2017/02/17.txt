====== Friday 17 Feb 2017 ======

Spent yesterday doing a software installation for Dean Close School.  That is now in and running so I'm hoping for some feedback from them soon.

Targets for today:

[ ] Fix niggles from three days ago in my exam invigilation stuff
[ ] Update staging server with latest Abingdon data
[ ] Push this software to it
[ ] Give Niki, Ben and Ian exam privileges
[ ] Tell them about it.  Ask to meet with Ian.

I can't help wondering whether there will be security issues (tokens) when I run it in live mode.  Well, this is my chance to find out.

Just hit an interesting little quirk of Backbone - although perfectly sensible when you think about it.

I was trying to set the room value back to being empty, but nothing was happening.  This was simply because I'd failed to update my model from my view when I started the creation process.  I read the values from the fields, and used them to try to create a //new// model, but I didn't update the one which I'd already got.  The values in it thus remained as they always were (blank in this case), and when I set it back to blank it didn't think it was an update and so didn't trigger a render.  One to watch out for.

For consistency, when I read out the fields from my view I should apply the new values to my existing model.
