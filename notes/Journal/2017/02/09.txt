My big hold up at the moment is that I can't seem to get the auto-complete fields to fill in the corresponding ID field.  I could work around it by using the text of the auto-complete field and sending that up to the host.  Provided it was un-tampered with it would then be possible to find the relevant record and attach it.

It is a frig though, and not totally satisfactory.  This also gives me an opportunity to learn more about de-bugging JavaScript.  I should be able to work out why it's not happening - it's probably something in the way I've set up my field data.

Well, there's something interesting.  It appears that the autocomplete function initializes itself only when you first select the field for input.  How, I'm not sure.  A good cause for some serious code reading I think.
