Things to try to get done today.

[*] Implement a Backbone collection to fetch and display the room ProtoEvents
[ ] Get all the fields working in the add event line
[ ] Actually add an event
[ ] Get event editing working

That's quite a lot for one day.  See what we can do.

I've just had a thought.  Should [[:Models:ProtoEvent|ProtoEvent]] records link directly to the events which they generate?  Not via event source and source id, but an actual database connection.  Each [[:Models:ProtoEvent|ProtoEvent]] has_many Event records, and each Event record belongs_to a [[:Models:ProtoEvent|ProtoEvent]] record.  Would that affect any existing code?  I don't think so.  Nor should it affect the efficiency of the existing codebase - code which isn't interested in that field in an event can simply ignore it as it does at present.

It's a thought.  It would be neat.  Think about it over a cup of coffee.

After half a cup of coffee, I think I have the answer - yes, they should be linked.  It's not a big d/b change.  Let's do it now.
