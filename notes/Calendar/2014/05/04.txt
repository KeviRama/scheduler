Plan for tomorrow.

Start with a plain HTML page and add:

* Foundation structure
* Menu bar
* Pop-down menus with sub-items
* A modal text box
* A modal form
* Fullcalendar in the page

Checking at each stage that everything works correctly, including navigating away by link to an adjoining page, and then back again.  If I can get all that working, then compare with my Rails app to see what I'm doing differently.  I suspect I am failing to initialise something properly.

Another point of note is that Chrome's console throws some error messages relating to my JavaScript.  I could try to understand what those mean.
