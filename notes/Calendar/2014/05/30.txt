I realised last night that I should do my utmost to conceal the inner workings of group membership.  Currently I have something like this:

{{./diagram.png?type=diagram}}

But from the point of view of client code, we're really only interested in the Visible Group and the Entity.  All the methods for manipulating membership of a group should exist on the VG and Entity (by means of mixing code in) and should return VGs and Entities.  If you want to add an Element to a group, or check its membership of a group, then you can, but the expectation is that you will expect to pass, and more importantly to receive, entities.

There could potentially be a flag on a method call indicating that you do want to get the intermediate types back.

As part of this, I also need to re-implement the Entity<=>Element relationship as a Concern.
