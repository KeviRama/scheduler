====== Sunday 23 Nov 2014 ======

Looking at promoting some of my recent changes onto the live system, which will need a bit of care.

Steps:

[*] Back up live database.
[*] export RAILS_ENV=production
[*] Pull down latest code
[*] bundle install
[*] bundle exec rake db:migrate
[*] bundle exec rake assets:precompile
[*] touch tmp/restart.txt
[*] Re-run last night's import job
