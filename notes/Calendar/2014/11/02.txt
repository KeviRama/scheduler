It occurs to me that it will be some time before people stop using the /ical/jhw style URLs, if indeed they ever do.  I therefore need to optimise the processing of that too, to get the same speed increases which I achieved for the ones my element no.

Current timing:

On my test system: 6235ms (AR 676.3ms)

2nd attempt: 6752ms (AR 307.4ms)

With enhanced code: 2444ms (AR 220.3ms)

File seem identical except for the order of multiple locations.

And with a bit more work got it down to:

2074ms (AR 63.7ms)

What difference will it make on the live system?

Before this change: 10517ms (AR 859.2ms)

After the change: 4101ms (AR 195.1ms)

Again, the files are identical apart from the order of multiple locations.  Excellent.


I need a method which, given any entity, and a period of time, finds all the groups which the element is a member of at any time during the specified interval.  For each of these groups, I then want a start and end date for each of the memberships.
