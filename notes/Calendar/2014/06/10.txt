Thinking about the structure of the SB loading code, I think I want something like this:

SB_Loader.new(params for file parsing) do |loader|
  loader.staff
  loader.pupils
  loader.locations
  loader.teaching_groups
  loader.tutor_groups
  loader.lessons
  loader.cover
  loader.invigilation
end

Gets the general flow of what happens all in one place.  If we don't succeed in loading a whole set of files then we don't do any processing at all.  Perhaps work on that tomorrow.
