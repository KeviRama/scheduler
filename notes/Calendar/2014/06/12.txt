====== Thursday 12 Jun 2014 ======

I have a small problem to fix from last night, where existing events got shuffled through the calendar to the last fortnight of the year.  I know why it happened though.  Enhance code to fix.

What could I usefully do tomorrow?

* Implement login
* Add resource usage to calendar entries
* Load duty slots
* Check and adjust resources associated with existing events during loading
* Load cover information from SB
* Add week letters to ical export
* Take account of study leave when loading events
* Provide a fast-select on the left to view the timetable of other resources.
* Printable timetable for any resource
* Preps?

I surely have to try to parse the cover records first?
