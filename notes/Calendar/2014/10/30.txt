====== Thursday 30 Oct 2014 ======

I'm starting to think that, short of implementing my own feed editing mechanism with full boolean logic, the easiest way to provide an OR condition on calendar feeds is simply to use two feeds.  It would thus be necessary to have two feeds to get both cover and invigilation.

Is there much of an overhead to having such a small feed?  Test.

Let's say that specifying an element id of 0 means you want breakthrough events.  Implement and test.  It took 155ms to prepare and download the file of key dates - I can live with that.

All that stuff is now on the live system and seems to be working.  Good stuff.

On to trying to import the latest version of the calendar.  Need to remember how to download it from the calendar site.  As I recall it:

* Log in
* Choose Export
* Leave file type as CSV
* Dates from now until about the end of August next year.
* Upload file to my test system
* Set to import

Actually, let's go for dates from the start of October, because some events straddle half term.

That seems to have been tolerably successful.  Shall I do the same on the live system?  Done.

Aaaargh!  Something has got terminally confused on the live system, although not on my test system. When I look at events now, I see a week of mine, then a week of Alex Taylor's.  What's going on?

There's an error occuring in the schedule controller.  Line 18.  Trying to take the id of a nil class.  Why?  Why does the problem not occur on my test system?  Ah - there's a hard coding somewhere of the invigilation category, and I've changed its name.  Fixed it.  And although I had changed the name on the test system too, I've subsequently reloaded the d/b so it changed back.
