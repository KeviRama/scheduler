I'm starting to think that, short of implementing my own feed editing mechanism with full boolean logic, the easiest way to provide an OR condition on calendar feeds is simply to use two feeds.  It would thus be necessary to have two feeds to get both cover and invigilation.

Is there much of an overhead to having such a small feed?  Test.

Let's say that specifying an element id of 0 means you want breakthrough events.  Implement and test.  It took 155ms to prepare and download the file of key dates - I can live with that.
