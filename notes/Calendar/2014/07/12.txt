====== Saturday 12 Jul 2014 ======

My intention now is to start on the summer's work.  I have potentially 7 weeks at my disposal, and I want to end up with something useful at the end of it, but without working myself to a frazzle.  I therefore intend to produce a short-list of functionality which is needed by September and do that - anything more is a bonus.

List moved to [[:Summer targets|Summer targets]]
