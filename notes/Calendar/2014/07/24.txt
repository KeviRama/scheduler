====== Thursday 24 Jul 2014 ======

Despite having implemented restrictions on menu access, I still seem to be getting someone else editing my records.  Hugh Price seems to have been messed about with yesterday.  Let's take another look.  Perhaps first on my list today should be the implementation of real access restrictions.

It's noticeable someone keeps trying to get a URL of just "/eak".  Suggests a script of some sort.  I think a web crawler is one of my problems.  That should be easy to fix.

Hugh Price is ID 2065.  Yes, it was edited at about 02:28 this morning.  Last edit of any sort was on 15/7 and may well have been me.  Yes, it was when I was marking staff as active.  Where did the request come from?  188.143.232.211.  Does not translate to a real domain.  There were 25 requests of various sorts from there.  It's interesting how it's still being found, despite the removal of the menus.  I've had no-one register an account apart from school staff, which suggests that the links are being remembered somehow.

First check is to make sure only logged on users can access anything other than just the calendar page.
