Next I think I want the means to view and even edit aspects of the User record.

Currently user's have Ownerships, but I think they also need Interests.  If you're Interested in something (no matter how temporarily) then its appointments appear on your calendar display.  In general, Users can't edit their Ownerships, but they can do anything they like with their Interests.

Clicking on the current user's name at the top of the screen should do a User#show for that user, with a predictive text box to add Interests.
