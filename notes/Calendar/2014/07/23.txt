Objectives for today.

[ ] Promote what I've done to the live system (copying data back there).
[ ] My test suite is now totally FUBARed.  Fix it.
[ ] Deleting a member of staff should delete his tutor groups and their groups.
[ ] When a teaching group changes its name, any events derived from it might change too.
[ ] Get the program to show how many groups each pupil *will* be in.
[ ] Element records should inherit the current flag from their entities (for speed of searching)


And the individual stages for getting what I've done back to the live system are:

[ ] Check in all my current source and add a tag
[ ] Send to live system
[ ] Dump database on dev
[ ] Send to live system
[ ] Stop web server (and app) on Mach2
[ ] Dump live database
[ ] Import new code
[ ] Load new database contents
[ ] Start up again

Sounds too easy - I've probably missed something.
