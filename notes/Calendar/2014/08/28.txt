Just noticed two interesting things:

1. When the user isn't logged in, navigating through FullCalendar doesn't change the date on the little calendar.
2. The system ignores the EventCategory flags when deciding what to show on the not-logged-in display.

Both should be fairly simple (famous last words.)
