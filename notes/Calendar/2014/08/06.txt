In HTML, can one have a check-box field without any surrounding form - that is, one gets the tick/untick behaviour, but there's no way actually to submit it.  It seems I can in IceWeasel at least.  How about Chrome?  Yes, Chrome too.

Done some of that, although not finished.  In the light of my meeting at school today I now have the following as my priorities for the coming few days:

[ ] Allow users (or at least, some users) to create events with resources.
[ ] Allow the creation of personal groups.
[ ] Provide Janet and Sarah with a print out of rooms.
[ ] Add auto-groups to the loading process.
