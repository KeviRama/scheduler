I think I want to get resource selection working by the time I go to school on Wednesday.  The gem rails3-jquery-autocomplete seems a good bet for a first attempt, although I may want to change things later.

Just discovered something which might be useful - the concept of a resource view for FullCalendar.  Unfortunately this doesn't ever seem to have made it into the mainstream code, but lots of people have done different implementations, so I might be able to achieve something.
