====== Sunday 29 Mar 2015 ======

I achieved a lot with my Days controller yesterday, but there's a bit of tweaking still to do before I go live with it.

[ ] Make events appear in chronological order within a day
[ ] Make Week letters un-compactable
[ ] Take notice of the Eventcategory pecking order when sorting (later useful to make key dates like Maundy Thursday come to the top).
[ ] Allow the end date of a long event to be shown too?  Append "ends".

As a new philosophy, I intend not to keep all the Events in the Day record, but instead generate all the required texts at the moment when the event is added, then discard the events.
