DJD has a problem in that he wants to get all the calendar data into some sort of file (typically Excel) and currently what he's getting has problems.

What's happening at the moment is that Ben W is taking the ical feed from Scheduler into Google Calendar.  It is then apparently being fed out again to Firefly and the school web site.  The problems are:

1. It lags - up to about 24 hours
2. Sometimes events appear twice or not at all.

Karen is now in the position that she is pretty confident about what she has in Scheduler, but DJD can't get it the way he wants it.  I therefore propose to provide an alternative download mechanism from Scheduler where he can get the same data, but (ideally) in Excel spreadsheet format.  If I can't manage that then my fallback position is to use CSV.

Excel spreadsheets by default seem to be pretty complicated, but apparently it is possible to generate a small subset of the file format and Excel will still read it.  Let's try that first.

Ryan Bates has a Railscast on the subject, and as ever he does it so much more nicely than I have done to date.

Hmm.  Done some initial experimentation with what Ryan thinks is an Excel file, but Excel itself refuses to open it.

I could try using a package to generate my xlsx file.  As ever the choice is wide.
