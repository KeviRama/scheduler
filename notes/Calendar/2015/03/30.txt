====== Monday 30 Mar 2015 ======

Interesting query from DJD.  He's noticed that the Common Entrance week scheduled for the 1st of June isn't currently in scheduler.  This puzzles me slightly because it does appear to be in the CSV file which I loaded from the last backup.  When did I load it into Scheduler, and was it ever there?

The file is date Mar 15th.  I would have loaded it immediately afterwards, so it makes sense to look at the d/b dump from that night.  Happily that should be backed up on Guardian (I hope).  I can re-load it into my development system and take a look.

Yes - it was there on the 1st of June.  Has it been a) deleted or b) had its category changed?  Event id was 303674.

Deleted on 26th March at precisely 13:59:29 - just 50 minutes before the new entry for lower school exams was entered.  Request came from 217.158.134.98.
