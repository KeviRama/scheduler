A further amendment to help the school out of a hole.  A bit of a frig, but I should be able to reverse it out later and put a proper structure in place.

Add a preferred_event_category to the user record which, if present, will:

1. Pre-fill the event category when that user creates a new event.
2. Allow the user to edit any event of that category.
3. Allow the user to see automatically any event of that category.

The last of these can just happen to start with, but should then appear as a coloured box and have the means to un-select it.
