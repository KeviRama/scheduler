====== Tuesday 16 Jun 2015 ======

An interesting problem has arisen, in that one particular lesson (suspended) seems to be being loaded into Scheduler multiple times.  It's one of Alison Quick's lessons (AKQ) and it's with S3 Y Dr-2 on Thu of Week B in period 4.  The two entries both have the same source ID - 352634.

I'm looking at Thu 18th June where there are two copies - one suspended and one not.  It also occurs twice two weeks earlier, when neither is suspended.

Hang on - one of the two in each case has an event source of "Manual".  Could Nick have been editing them?  Does the event source get changed automatically if you do?  Ah - it doesn't get changed automatically for an edit, but it does for a clone.  Has Nick been messing with the Clone button?

Let's see how many events have a source of Manual but are owned by System.  Ah - it's not cloning, because that sets the owner as well.  Still want to know how many.  There are 55 events with a source of Manual but owned by the system.

Solved it - it's Nick trying to cope with SB's inability to re-room lessons.  He needs to change the room, but the feed from SB will immediately change it back if he doesn't change the event source.  The trouble is, it now can't find the event which it's expecting, so it re-creates it and we end up with a duplicate event.

Spoken to Nick - he's trying to cope with requirements for re-rooming.  SB fails miserably in this regard (just can't do it at all!) so he's trying to do it through Scheduler.
