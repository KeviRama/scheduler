My objective today is to promote the new code to the live system.  This will involved re-merging my git branches, testing again on the staging server, and then deploying.  Could also do to make sure that mach2 has been backed up recently.

Steps:

[*] Back up live database
[*] Take a note of what version of s/w it is running.
[ ] export RAILS_ENV=production
[ ] Pull down new software
[ ] rake [[db:migrate]]
[ ] rake [[assets:precompile]]
[ ] touch tmp/restart.txt
[ ] Give VJA her groups
[ ] Remove same groups from auto-loader

Version on live server is:
