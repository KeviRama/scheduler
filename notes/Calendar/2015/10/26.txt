====== Monday 26 Oct 2015 ======

Had a bit of a hiatus on Friday due to Dad's problems with TalkTalk.  Now see what I can usefully do today.

[*] Tidy up the colours of the approve/reject buttons
[*] Add a message to each rejection, and record who rejected it.
[ ] Drag-n-drop currently circumvents the permissions structure - fix that.
[ ] Send an e-mail to the event's owner when it is complete or something gets rejected
[ ] A flag to refresh the screen when the dialogue closes
[ ] Update the count in the menu more often?
[ ] When the user asks to look at a pending approval, make sure the concern is visible

Start by taking a fresh copy of the live database from school, then loading and converting it.  Do I need to remove any "controls" flags?

Hit an interesting problem with the idea of returning a message for each rejection.  Do I do it by way of a hidden form, or as part of the URL?  If the latter, I need to escape certain characters should they be entered - which ones?  Ah - there's a function, escapeURIComponent(), which seems to do the necessary.  I do however need to guard against someone somehow clicking the same button twice - if they do, I don't want to add the modifier twice.
