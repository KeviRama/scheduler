Things to do before putting the new version on the staging server:

[*] Search for references to Interests and Ownerships in the code
[*] Fix editing of events by admin
[*] Check new facilities work for non admin users
[*] Check suitable ownerships in place

and I also need to think about the steps needed.

[*] New code to staging system
[*] bundle install
[*] rake assets:precompile
[*] Fresh copy of live database and load
[*] Drop the concerns table if you have previously created it.
[*] RAILS_ENV=production
[*] Rake [[db:migrate]]
[*] Run method to create Concerns
[*] Drop rows from Interest and Ownership tables (but not the tables)
[*] Check on ownerships - Nick Lloyd needs to own his various spaces.
[*] Set AS Reception's default event category to be "Meeting"
