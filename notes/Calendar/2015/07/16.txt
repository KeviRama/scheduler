====== Thursday 16 Jul 2015 ======

OK - one week of holiday then nearly a week of recovery time (from term, not from the holiday) and I hope I'm ready to do some serious design and coding.

My first task is to collate my list of desired enhancements, and then put them in order of implementation.  Some are essential for next term (e.g. end-of-year rollover) whilst others are merely desirable.  Currently a lot are on the whiteboard, some are in Wunderlist and others are in e-mails.  I think I need to sort them on paper, then put them into a structured list in Wunderlist (in Wunderlist, so I can access it from anywhere).

Currently I'm part way through some of the changes in my code repository, so I'll need to finish those off.  It will be a good warming-up exercise.

What have I got then?

* Implement Calendar-ness as an attribute.  Disable old Calendar category.
* Tidy up the screen - backbone and bootstrap
* Allow notes to be attached to events
* Flag to show or hide the calendar for each user
* Different colours for different owned resources
* Roll-over for Scheduler
* Roll-over for Markbook
* Permanent groups - not tied to the current era
* Preps in Scheduler (possibly implemented as notes on events?)
* Fix iCal feed - add in missing fields
* Permissions for resources / tentative commitments / express interest in events
* Approvals procedure for resources requiring permission.
* Documentation - cheat sheets for things like event categories.
* Tests
* Repeating events
* Templates for events - music lessons
* Reference field for organiser of event
* Allow room cover to be entered (SB doesn't handle this).
* Audit trail
* Allow events from SB to be amended without ending up duplicated.
* Automated import of sports fixtures
* Allow core time and other time for an event.  E.g. setup time before a show.
* Allow ical downloads to specify locations in the body text (or should the client do this?)
* Search facility on events
* Predictive text boxes should auto-select first item.
* Dynamic on/off for event visibility.  Implement existing tick boxes
* Real time clash checking in the front end?  As an event is entered.

OK - I've entered all those into Wunderlist, and categorised them a bit.  I'll keep this list as a historical record.
