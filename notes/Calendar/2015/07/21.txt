====== Tuesday 21 Jul 2015 ======

Just made an interesting discovery about SQL (or at least, about MySQL).

If a field in a row is NULL, then it doesn't pass any tests apart from "IS NULL".  It seems fairly obvious that it won't pass:

select * from table where field = 1;

but the weird thing is that it also won't pass:

select * from table where field != 1;

It will only pass:

select * from table where field is null;

This means that I need to make sure that my fields are not null if I want to be able to find them reliably.

To do today:

[ ] Get web-based display and editing of users working
[ ] Switch the fetching of events to be by concern rather than by element id.
[ ] Get my admin editor-ness working again.
[ ] Do all the new bits work for non-admin users?
