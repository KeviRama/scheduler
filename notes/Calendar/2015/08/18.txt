====== Tuesday 18 Aug 2015 ======

A new requirement has arisen in the context of period times.  On Wednesdays, OTL has entered periods as:

Period 6: 14:05 - 14:25
Period 7: 14:30 -

but DJD has just said that he wants:

Period 6: 14:05 - 14:35
Period 7: 14:40 -

There aren't actually any lessons showing up in period 7 yet, but I can adjust period 6 appropriately using my loading script.

Tested it - it seems to work.  I'll leave deploying it until tomorrow though, just in case.
