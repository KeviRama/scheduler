Currently documenting all the current event categories and planning how to change them.

I need to add a "privileged" flag to both event categories and users.  Then I can re-work my conversion script to conform to my new document.  It should be capable of taking a fresh copy of the live database and doing all the necessary changes.  In some cases it can even merge existing categories.

I think I can also get rid of some of the existing flags in event categories.  They currently are:

* schoolwide		Appears on all user's schedules
* publish		Can be downloaded via ical.  If a user doesn't specify categories, all these are sent.
* public			Superseded by the "Calendar" property - can go.
* for_users		Likewise, superseded.  Replace with schoolwide.
* unimportant	Not important enough to prevent use for cover.
* can_merge		Events can be merged to provide cover.
* can_borrow		Events with multiple staff can lose staff to cover.
* compactable	When downloading "days" information, event can be compacted.
* deprecated		On its way out
* privileged		Can only be selected by privileged users.
