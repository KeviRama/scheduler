====== Wednesday 12 Aug 2015 ======

Back from a short trip to Preston, and needing to start work on importing next year's data - OTL has finally managed to get at least some of it into SB.

Before I do that, I think I should re-test the conversion of the live system (using the staging server) and then do the actual live conversion.  Instructions for the process are in the calendar for [[:Calendar:2015:08:04|4th August]]. I have made a few small changes to the code since I last ran them, so I'll do them again now on the staging server.

In fact, to be really cautious, I should do it on the development server first.  OK - back to the master branch and here we go.

Check that I can still get a calendar feed from the staging server into Google Calendar.  Yes, I can.

I have just done some very nasty frigging of the appearance of the concerns in the left hand column.  Zurb Foundation by default makes them far too big, and only seems to provide the means to change them for //all// tables.  I want to change just that one table, which probably shouldn't be a table anyway.  The whole area needs a complete re-work so for now I'm just going to do this.  I feel soiled.

OK - think the moment has come to promote the live system.  Just in case I need to revert, what version of software is it currently running?

Good.

Typing in all DJD's twilight meetings for the term - then I'll do his key dates for the year.

Done all David's dates.  It occurs to me that, as tomorrow is results day, I really need to break off and start looking at the results import process again.  It may have rusted.  The end-of-year rollover will have to wait a little while.
