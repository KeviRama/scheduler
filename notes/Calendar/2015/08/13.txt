Now testing my end-of-year instructions from yesterday on my staging server.  I found one error - I wasn't actually keeping count of how many groups were terminated at the end of the year.

Interesting to see how long the new data load takes to run on the staging server.  It's in live mode and running on an SSD, but not quite such a powerful processor.  It took 67m and 33s, which is quite a while.  An immediate second run takes 3m 42s and reports nothing apart from not being able to find Jeremy Thomas.

Probably about the point to stop on porting all that stuff.  Take a look at how well it exports to GC.
