====== Saturday 15 Aug 2015 ======

My major objective for today is to do end-of-year on the live Scheduler system and then load my first set of data from SB.  This will need to be done very carefully indeed.

For the next few days I will then run updates from SB manually, just in case of surprises.  I should probably do each first on the staging server, then on the live server.

Once I have done the roll-over, I can add "New Staff 2015" to the relevant INSET events.

What version of s/w is on:

Midnight:	28890c18fbc
Scheduler:	28890c18fbc

Let's tag that as the release for doing the live rollover.

Rolled over the live system.  1015 groups belonging to the previous year have been terminated.

Now running the first import of the new year's data on the live system.  That may well take a long while.  Freddie Mallinson has indeed moved back by one academic year - good.  It's got as far as creating teaching groups and adding pupils to them.

It is taking quite a while - something like 3 hours so far - but it's getting there.  All being well, subsequent runs will be faster.  Once it has created my extra groups, I can edit the New Staff INSET events.  Hah!  Forgot to put a time command on the beginning, so I won't know how long it took.  Order of 3 hours though.  My best guess is 3 hours 30 mins.  Excellent.  Now run it again to see what final discrepancies there are.
