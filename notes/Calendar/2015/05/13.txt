====== Wednesday 13 May 2015 ======

Investigating something slightly odd.  Every day or two, it seems that Ian changes *all* the future invigilations, which seems unlikely somehow.  I need to analyse my code to see what the actual changes are.  What does my code consider to be a change?

Just realised I am not counting invigilations added to the d/b.  I add them, but don't count them.  Perhaps that's it.  They're really additions, but I count only the fact that I am adding resources to the newly created events.  Amend and test again.  Yes, that does seem to be the explanation.
