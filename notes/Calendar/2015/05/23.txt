====== Saturday 23 May 2015 ======

List of things needing addressing soon:

[*] Processing of oddities in cover/invigilation records - complete re-work
[ ] Change the way that suspension records are interpreted
[ ] Add the ability to specify additional suspension records
[ ] Suspend lower school lessons during their exams
[ ] Change the duty slots for the second half of term

And then I can think about moving on to the actual enhancements planned for half term - organiser for an event, which wants an improved version of the predictive text boxes.
