List of things needing addressing soon:

[*] Processing of oddities in cover/invigilation records - complete re-work
[*] Change the way that suspension records are interpreted
[ ] Should we allow suspension of things other than lessons - e.g. registration.
[*] Add the ability to specify additional suspension records
[*] Suspend lower school lessons during their exams
[ ] Change the duty slots for the second half of term
[*] Stop multiple clash reports where a person is committed to an event more than once.

And then I can think about moving on to the actual enhancements planned for half term - organiser for an event, which wants an improved version of the predictive text boxes.

My change to the way lessons are suspended has resulted in 120 amendments to atomic timetable events, and 3 amendments to compound timetable events.  I need to know what those are and why.  They may be correct; they may not.
