Need to start planning how to add Notes to the system.  As I see it, these are simple text fields which can be attached anywhere.  Features:

* Free format text
* Can be attached to pretty much any existing object - event, commitment, resource etc.
* Several types, but probably not done using personae as yet - just a type field.
* Can have one or more uploaded files attached.
* Belong to a user
* Can be public or private.  (Published or confidential).  Also an intermediate case where they're open to anyone involved in the event.
* Can be used for lesson plans, event requirements, general descriptions, description of attached file.
* Users can add private notes to events which they can't edit.

Probably worth creating the Note and Attachment records simultaneously.  Files could be put in the database as BLOBs, but probably better kept in the filing system with a reference to a uniquely generated name.  Each user's files go in a separate directory, and he can upload two of the same original name without overwriting.
