====== Sunday 22 Nov 2015 ======

Moving up towards a releasable (although not complete) version of commitment editing.  What's needed to make it useful?

[*] Finish off the flags for reports from the daily controller.
[*] Get the date fields working too.
[*] Save the flags (and dates?) between invocations.
[ ] Produce a useful listing of group memberships.
[ ] Basic info in three cols at the bottom - or just suppress that bit for now?
[*] For elements with a preferred colour, can I add that colour to the colour picker?
[ ] Need to enhance the days model to make it take notice of the tentative and firm flags.

And then I think I'll be able to show it to people.

Three things above didn't make the cut.
