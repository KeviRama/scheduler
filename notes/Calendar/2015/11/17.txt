Objectives for today:

[*] Fix loading script so it doesn't keep trying to delete the same tag group.
[*] E-mails to individuals about outstanding approvals.
[ ] More display of information - start with being able to click on Concerns.

Hit an interesting problem caused by Zim.  If you have the Version Control module enabled (which it is by default) then it adds files willy-nilly to your git repository - not just its own, but all the files in the managed directory.  I only noticed this after I'd committed some stuff, with the result that's lots of unwanted bits had been added too.

You need to stop and restart Zim after turning off version control in order to get it to stop this insane behaviour.

To correct the problem, use:

'''
git reset --soft HEAD^
git reset
'''

which seems to move the head pointer back to before the commit, then unstage the staged files.

Now - how about generating notification e-mails?  I want to generate (at most) one per user, so I will need to collate the information first.  Note that these go to users, not to staff.
