OK - today I'm going to have a push to get something I can put up for demonstration purposes.  Arguably, what I already have meets that criterion, but I'll see how much else I can get in.

First thing I propose to do is to remove the read-only flag from a note.  Only if it is attached to a promptnote which is marked as read-only should it behave read-only-ly.  That way, the prompt note can potentially be changed later, and all current notes will change too.

I could do with a couple of fake services for demonstration purposes.

Cephalopod care - read only.
Transport - with a reasonably long description


Just noticed something - if the owner of a resource adds it to an event then it doesn't get its corresponding note.  Should it?

Ah - no notes are being attached at all.  It also takes two goes to attach a note-enabled resource.  Clearly I've broken something, but what?  Trying to write to the read_only attribute seems to be the problem.  Why does it succeed at the second attempt?  The second attempt doesn't create the commitment - it just refreshes the display.  Fixed that.

I think I'm approaching the point where I could promote it to my staging server.  Most of the issues have now been addressed.
