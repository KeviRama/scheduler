ASH has asked about the possibility of letting the week display start on a Monday instead of a Sunday. FullCalendar supports this, and it raises quite a few interesting ideas about the chain of changes needed.  I also noticed whilst talking to ASH that if an ordinary user (not admin) clicks on his or her name, messy things happen.  It's meant to show their user details, but I haven't set the permissions up correctly.

So - what should happen?

* Not logged in - name is not there
* Unknown user - link should not be there
* Known ordinary user - can edit some basic functionality
* Admin user - can edit rather more

And I'll need a new field in the User record to store the preferred day of the week.  Let's give it a go.  New branch.

Add a new field to the User record called firstday, which defaults to 0 - Sunday.  I already have a basic editing form, so all I should need to do is add a new field to that - and perhaps tidy it up a bit.
