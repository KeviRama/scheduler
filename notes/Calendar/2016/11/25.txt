====== Friday 25 Nov 2016 ======

Yesterday was a day of diversions, and today is starting a little late, but...

[*] Tidy up the buttons on the user edit screen
[*] Integrate three development branches, losing the unnecessary_button flag
[*] Fix the auto-submit not to submit when empty.
[*] Test all three features together.
[*] Push to staging server for Niki to look at
[ ] Perhaps some documentation - demo system?

I propose to create a new feature branch in which to merge these three features, keeping the old branches in case I decide, for instance, to go for just two later.  feature/three-features.  Create the new branch, then merge all three of the others in.  There is some code to remove there too.

Added feature/search-users
Added feature/add-add-button

Two clashes:

[*] app/views/users/_form.html.erb
[*] app/controllers/users_controller.rb

Added feature/auto-commit

One clash:

[*] app/views/users/_user.html.erb

And now need to run up a system and test all these bits working together.
