====== Tuesday 15 Nov 2016 ======

Tolerably successful yesterday achieving a 4-fold speed increase on the checker.  Today I need to package that up with a few other tweaks and push them out.  Job list:

[*] Deal with several small e-mails
[*] Have the checker touch a flag file when it finishes.
[*] Package up release
[*] Test
[ ] Deploy
[*] Make sure all cron jobs are on live system
[ ] Make list of potential things to do next.

Packaged up release.  Taken a fresh copy of the live database, and now about to do a clash checking run.  See how long it takes.  It took 35m53s to do two weeks (less one Monday - yesterday).
