====== Tuesday 15 Nov 2016 ======

Tolerably successful yesterday achieving a 4-fold speed increase on the checker.  Today I need to package that up with a few other tweaks and push them out.  Job list:

[*] Deal with several small e-mails
[*] Have the checker touch a flag file when it finishes.
[*] Package up release
[*] Test
[*] Deploy
[*] Make sure all cron jobs are on live system
[*] Make list of potential things to do next.

Packaged up release.  Taken a fresh copy of the live database, and now about to do a clash checking run.  See how long it takes.  It took 35m53s to do two weeks (less one Monday - yesterday).

Now - the problem of what to do next is a big one - there are just too many things, all of which I would like to work on.

* Niki wants to be able to search lists.  He has suggested a rather tempting looking JS library called w2ui, which would add a lot to the application.  It might even completely replace Zurb Foundation, although it doesn't seem to do the same amount of formatting.  It has a neater appearance and better widgets.  I don't know whether it works well with mobile devices, but then my app doesn't at present anyway.
* As an alternative, I could add a simple predictive text field at the top of the paginated list, which lets you pick and view the one which you want.  Or I could add a filter, which lets you produce a reduced list.
* Lynn wants immediate notifications when someone cancels a request for the library.  Seems a bit OTT to me, but not too difficult to do.
* Upgrade to a later version of FullCalendar and then let the periods appear somehow as background events (which seem to require FC 2.2).
* Repeating events - I started on these and then got diverted.
* Provide sub-editing permissions for event organisers.  Can add and remove resources, but not move the event.
* Requesting and allocating pool resources like mini-buses, phones or meeting rooms.
* Provide the means to enter room cover (or indeed, any cover) including the permissions bit.  One would thus request to re-locate an existing lesson to an ICT room, rather than making a separate booking for the room.

Rather arbitrarily, but because Niki has mentioned it twice, I'm going to have a go at adding a search box to the users list.  He kind of indicated that the candy-striped periods were more urgent, but I think that was simply because a couple of people have asked for them rather than because he actually believed in it.  I believe it should also be a bit of well-proven code.

Currently, only the elements controller contains auto-complete functions.  The user display page needs a minimal form putting in above the list.  It would be good to be able to go back to the list from the display of a user, automatically selecting the page which that user is on.

Interesting trying to get my form to go to a place rather than submitting data.  There are various ways to do it, but I think probably an onsubmit() function which issues a request and suppresses the normal submission is probably the best way.  Let's try it.
