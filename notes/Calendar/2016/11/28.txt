====== Monday 28 Nov 2016 ======

Had a tolerably productive time at the weekend, playing with a demo system and doing slightly more with the documentation.  I want to push on with that today.

[*] Get schedulerdemo.xronos.uk running through Passenger
[*] Make sure it is accessible from outside.
[*] Set up a calendar feed from it
[*] Enhance my LetsEncrypt certificate for that domain
[*] Add https://schedulerdemo.xronos.uk
[*] Make http deflect to https
[*] Test calendar feed redirection
[*] Add demo mode login - configurable in system settings
[*] The calendar colour for non-logged-in users should be dictated by the preferred colour in its element.
[*] Tell ASH about it.

Quite a lot to attempt to do - let's see how I get on.

The Passenger documentation now seems to be excellent, with blow-by-blow instructions on how to do things.

Up and running.  Hit a problem when I tried to access the calendar feed because my system lacks settings.  Need to do a bit more database initialisation.  At the very least, I need a current era.  Done that, and a perpetual era, and put in some skeletal settings.  Now seem to be able to download it - will Google like it?

It's reluctant to try it again, having failed once.  Presumably it will try again eventually.  However, by putting a spurious parameter on the end I managed to force it through.  Good stuff.

Now - need to remind myself how to enhance my LetsEncrypt certificate.  I'm fairly certain I have done it for at least one which I already have.  Who requested this one - me or root?  ISTR trying to do it as an ordinary user in at least one case.

I have a very clear recollection of writing some instructions for upgrading an existing installation to use https, but now I can't find them.  I can even remember how they began - "So you've decided to use LetsEncrypt...  Good idea."  Where they are though is anybody's guess.  Ah - they're in the LetsEncrypt directory of the application.  There's a README there.
