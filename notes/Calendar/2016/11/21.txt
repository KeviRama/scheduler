Interesting problem this morning - Niki reports that various people seem to have lost their feeds into Google Calendar.  Just tried it myself with RMF's schedule and it came through fine.

When was RMF's calendar last requested?  Never from the new server.  That is probably it.

We return to our originally scheduled entertainment.

I want to add some global edit and subedit flags to the user records.  These then will work like admin for allowing users to edit events.
