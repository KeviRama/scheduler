Still to do on the cover front.

[*] Take note of the flags (published etc.) provided by iSAMS.
[*] Check whether the clash processing code is producing suitable e-mails (and not crashing).
[*] Cron job (commented out) on VPS.

Start the day with a fresh copy of the live d/b on my test system, then load up today's files from iSAMS.

For clashes, I propose to create two clashing covers, and one cover for a suspended lesson.

Let's pick some clashing lessons, then have Charlotte cover one of Martin's suspended lessons.

Thu 8/9 period 5.  Both Martin and Charlotte are teaching.  Put Charlotte to cover Martin's lesson.  Event 400175.  Lesson 16591.

Trying it with just one clash to start with.  That seems to have produced an e-mail without difficulty.  Now let's try to add a cover for a suspended lesson.

Martin's lesson in period 2 on Tue 6/9.  Event 399521.  Lesson 16024.  Set Amy Atkinson to cover it.  Should lead to two diagnostics, because it overlaps with head's assembly.

No - it gives only one diagnostic because Amy's cover commitment is to a suspended lesson.  This doesn't cause a clash.  Good.  Now I just need some real covers from Ian.
