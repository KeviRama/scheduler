====== Tuesday 09 Aug 2016 ======

Looking further at the link between activities and events, it seems to be a two way link - group references event and event references group - which is poor d/b design.  I may want to use either.   Given that I have no problem having more than one group attached to an event, it may well be that I should use the Group => Event link, rather than the other way around.

For now I'll just get them all loaded.  Reversing the link later is trivial.

I will load all groups where the duration overlaps my era.  The iSAMS active flag seems to be equivalent to my current flag.  Just having it set to false doesn't mean the group should be deleted - just that it's passed its period of existence.  It still might be relevant to past events.

Just noticed that you can have pupils linked directly to events too.  Nice!  I'll import those too.  Ah - there are two extremely similarly named tables which seem to duplicate this functionality.  Presumably one of them is just left over from somewhere.  I'll need to use observation to see which of these is real.

There are duplicate tables for other bits too.  What I will need to do is create some records of my own, then see what tables they end up in.  One for next week, when I think I will need to make a visit to school.
