====== Friday 12 Aug 2016 ======

Objectives:

By Thursday (first results day) I would like to have the live Scheduler system running the new software with up-to-date information from iSAMS.  I don't anticipate that the import will be fully automatic by then - I see the data fetching being done automatically, and then me manually copying it to a test system, doing a test update there, then doing the same update on the live system.  I'd like a week or so of that before I let things happen fully automatically.

I can't do this on the new VPS by then, because that will need Niki to enable the VPS's IPv4 address for d/b access and he isn't back until Thursday.

Before that, I will need to do several test conversions on my staging server to make sure things work.  And before that, I need to tidy up all the odds and ends from the list of two days ago, and document the entire data conversion and roll-over process.  I am inclined to think I will change the end-of-era dates so that we are now in the new era.  Broadly the steps will be:

* Latest code
* Copy of live system data
* Convert database (rake db:migrate)
* Run maintenance methods (land_grab etc)

At which point you have a system which has simply been updated to the latest version of software.  I would then be inclined to to the end of year processing, which is documented one one of last year's pages.

* Edit era dates to make them end on, say, 12th August
* Run end_of_era method
* Create new next_era

And then we progress to loading the new year's data.  I think I need to do all of this on a development system and see how it goes.  Probably want to merge my developments back into the master stream before I start all of this.
