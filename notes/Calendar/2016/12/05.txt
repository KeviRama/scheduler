Various things which I could progress today:

[ ] Show memberships in detail for a group
[ ] Create ResourceGroups - or at least, think about them.
[ ] Finish off the OH date manipulation
[ ] Pupil timetable
[ ] Documentation

The second one almost certainly isn't going to happen today, but I can think about it.

If I'm going to show memberships in detail for a group, then it makes sense to revisit the whole area of constructing my display columns.  I had decided before that it could do with restructuring and generalising, but I've forgotten exactly what I intended.  Golly - I've even written myself a note about it.

Currently there's a bit of a hodge-podge of things which can be displayed in a
column.  Unify to a single DisplayColumn object which has:

Title
Pre-amble (pre-formatted HTML)
Groups of entries, each with a title
Post-amble (as for pre)

There should be precisely one bit of code which handles the generation of
columnar html.

Let's review the existing code and make it better.  I might want to add the ability to put tabular data in each column too.
