Having thought a bit more about the data import, and tried out the fundamentals of extracting data from iSAMS and loading it into Scheduler, I think I need to do the whole thing a lot more neatly.

I need some well-defined intermediate objects, which can be used to import data from either SB or iSAMS, and ideally from more systems in the future.  The fields in these intermediate objects will be driven very much by the fields defined in my Scheduler database records.  The intermediate objects should also contain the code needed to update the actual database records, reducing the application logic as far as possible.
