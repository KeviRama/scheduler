Got on to Locations, and here I think the processing can be slightly different.  In SB, the location naming was a mess, and the same location might crop up umpteen times.  I believe that iSAMS is rather tidier, and the locations each have just one name (and a source id).  OTOH, my locations in Scheduler don't have a source id - just a name.  Perhaps I will need to keep doing them via locationaliases.

Does creating a new locationalias cause a corresponding location to be created?  Yes, it appears to be intended to at least.

Slight problem in that iSAMS has no concept of a previous MIS id for locations.  I will therefore need to search first by source id, then by name to try to match them up.  A new facility not previously used.
