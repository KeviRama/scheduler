Really pleased with what I did yesterday.  Now need to think about merging those two development tracks.

feature/owned-locations
feature/subjects-as-elements, which follows on from feature/add-subjects

I think I need to check out owned-locations and merge in subjects-as-elements, because I intend to continue the development of owned-locations now.  Keep subjects-as-elements as a branch, in case you should choose to merge that straight into develop at a later date for any reason.  The next things which I intend to do in owned-locations rely on what I've done on subjects, so that branch does need to be merged in.

That seems to have merged pretty cleanly.  Enhanced the listing of subjects to use a slightly neater paginator like all the other items.

Now want to work on displaying sensible detail for each type of item.  For some reason, the element.groups() method, when set to recurse, is //much// slower than the way it was happening before, even though the old way produced far more detail.  Calling memberships_by_duration appears to be a lot faster.  Put some logging code in to check this.

'''

Calling memberships_by_duration() at 10:08:51.216
Finished calling at 10:08:51.354

That is startlingly faster.  1.641s vs 0.138s.  Admittedly, there might be some cacheing going on, but even so.

I need to enhance the MWD code to provide more general manipulation of the groups thus discovered.
