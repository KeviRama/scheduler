====== Tuesday 25 Oct 2016 ======

Well, yesterday was a bit of a washout.  Let's see if we can do better today.  Plan remains the same.

And before I even start there's a major interruption.  A house (!) is being delivered to Chalmore Gardens.  Broke off to take some photographs.

Made good progress, but as I draw to a close for today it occurs to me that I could usefully do yet another re-work, albeit a smaller one, of how the display stuff is assembled.  I'm currently overloading a thing which I've termed a GroupSetHolder.  It serves to produce a column of output with:

* A title (just the one)
* N sub-headings
* A list under each sub-heading.

It is currently assumed that each list is a list of groups, but if I step back a bit it could in fact be any kind of list.  It should be possible to unify this with DisplayPanel and DisplayColumn and allow the lists to contain any kind of thing, although usually the same thing under each sub-heading.  It would also be nice to be able to add some descriptive text after the title and before starting on the sub-headings.

Put that on a back-burner overnight, and think about doing it tomorrow (after I get to Preston).
