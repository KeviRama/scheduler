====== Sunday 10 Jul 2016 ======

Done some nice work allowing particular timetables to be loaded.

Hit a slight problem in that the week allocations for the coming academic year don't seem to be in my download file.  I wonder whether they're in iSAMS?  No, they're not.  Happily Karen has already put them into Scheduler so I can use that for reference.

It's actually loading stuff.  Interesting point to note - it is not deleting the erroneous stuff which I loaded earlier.  Need to fix that.  Indeed yes - that code is still all commented out.  I hadn't got that far.  Handy way to test it later though.

Finished by moving all the new stuff onto my staging server and doing an import there.

Took 26m38.344s to load on the staging server.  How long to run again?  And is it idempotent?  1m40.239s.  Excellent.
