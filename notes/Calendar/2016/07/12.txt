Things to try to achieve today:

[*] Auto groups - calculated ones
[*] Extra groups
[ ] Custom groups (which will come over as Tag groups)

Do I get any kind of useful list of subjects from iSAMS.  I kind of need it to create lists of who teaches what and who studies what.  There seems to be a subject ID on each teaching group.  But I don't have a list of subjects.  Do I need to tweak my API key?  Yes, there's a separate tick box for Departments and Subjects.  Try that.  I've ended up with a smaller file though - there may be information which has gone again because Pete has re-loaded everyone.  Try it though - just keep the old file.

Yes, interesting.  I now get 44 subjects, but all my tutor groups are empty, and there aren't any set lists either.  This may flummox me for a while.  Or could I cut and paste the subjects into another file?  Tried it - in data.6.xml.  This is data.4.xml, with the departments and subjects cut from data.5.xml - the one which lacks set lists.  That seems better.  Now, can I list my subjects?  Seem to have picked out all the right ones too.  Now can I use them to keep track of who teaches them or studies them, the latter ones broken down by year.
