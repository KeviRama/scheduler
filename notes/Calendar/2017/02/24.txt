Looking at the existing code for displaying [[:Models:Concern|Concern]] records, the logic is in the wrong place.  The view is taking decisions about what to display.  All this logic should be in the controller, and the view should simply display what it is given.

Worth fixing that first before I try to add my enhancements.  To start with, //just// move the logic - don't change the way in which it behaves.

Also need to move the styling into a CSS file rather than having it embedded.
