====== Wednesday 18 Jan 2017 ======

An interesting problem has arisen in the area of recurring events.

I wanted to add the means to schedule an event to happen on, for instance, the 1st Wednesday of each month.  But - all my code to date is built around weeks.  You can specify events as being in week A, or week B, or by default they will be in *both* weeks, but they won't happen at all outside term.  The processing simply doesn't occur if there is no current week letter.

This makes it interesting for a requirement like this, because it's possible that the user will want it to happen regardless of which week is extant - or they may want to restrict it to term time.  The particular meeting requested is an admin meeting, so probably happens regardless of whether it is term time or not.

I think I need the means to force events to happen even outside term - some special wild-card value to say //every// week, regardless of week letter or none.  Currently all we can specify is both weeks.
