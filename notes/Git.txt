====== Git ======
Created Sunday 20 April 2014

I need a source code control system for my project, and git is the obvious choice.  Historically I have used gitosis for my server, and whilst gitosis is no longer being developed I see no need to change at the moment.  I already have a gitosis server set up on git.sinodun.org.uk.

Having created the project directory, go into it and type:

'''
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
'''

This sets things up.  There is already a default ''.gitignore'' file provided by Rails.

Next we need to connect this up to our git server.

To add a new repository on git.sinodun.org.uk you first need to check out the gitosis configuration tree.

'''
$ git clone gitosis@git.sinodun.org.uk:gitosis-admin
'''

Then within that project you edit gitosis.conf and add your new repository.  Currently I have a single group of users (called for historic reasons, "markbook") and I add all the project areas to that group.  The section reads currently:

'''
[group markbook]
writable = markbook Wiki sample_app
members = john@liberty john@nimbus john@remote john@duplo john@zeitgeist john@cephalopod jhw@schoolmac john@knight john@acerrevo john@g5 john@sheeva2 john@data john@pragma john@hydra john@amtrak john@squeezeguest
'''

Add any extra repositories to the end of the second line there.  Then check the file back in again.

'''
$ git add gitosis.conf
$ git commit -m "Added scheduler repository"
$ git push origin
'''

Now move to your application source directory, and set it up as a git repository.

'''
$ git remote add origin gitosis@git.sinodun.org.uk:sample_app.git
$ git push origin master
$ git branch --set-upstream master origin/master
'''

and then all is hunky.  Interestingly though, that isn't enough to get the new project to appear in gitweb.  What else is needed?  Ah, on the server do the following:

'''
cd /var/cache/git
ln -s /srv/gitosis/repositories/sample_app.git
'''

and it will then appear.
