====== Git ======
Created Sunday 20 April 2014

I need a source code control system for my project, and git is the obvious choice.  Historically I have used gitosis for my server, and whilst gitosis is no longer being developed I see no need to change at the moment.  I already have a gitosis server set up on git.sinodun.org.uk.

Having created the project directory, go into it and type:

'''
git init
git add .
git commit
'''

This sets things up.  There is already a default ''.gitignore'' file provided by Rails.
