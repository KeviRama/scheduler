====== Rvm ======
Created Sunday 20 April 2014

Initial installation of Rvm was done in the [[:Bootstrap|Bootstrap]] section, but then I want to make sure I get the right version of things all the time.  Traditionally one put a ''.rvmrc'' file in the root directory of one's project containing:

'''
rvm use 2.1.1@scheduler
'''


but this now produces warning messages about incompatibility and deprecation.  It still works, but apparently we should now be using a .ruby-version file instead.  Let's try that.  Rvm provides a conversion command:

'''
rvm rvmrc to .ruby-version
'''


and what that seems to have done is to remove the .rvmrc file and replace it with two files called ''.ruby-version'' and ''.ruby-gemset'', containing the relevant information.

Finally, just installing Ruby 2.1.0 seems to have caused Rvm to make it my default Ruby, which I don't want.  The command to switch back to the system Ruby as the default is:

'''
$ rvm --default use system
'''


The correct version of Ruby now seems to be selected automatically.
