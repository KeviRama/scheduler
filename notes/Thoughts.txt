====== Thoughts ======
Created Sunday 20 April 2014

A thought on the overall user interface design, if it can be achieved.  The main view is of a calendar, and we then need the means to adjust things - either adjust what we've viewing, or adjust what is scheduled.

Can I have a series of pull-down blinds at the top, like tabs in a web browser, but when you click on one an interactive form of some sort slides down.  Some people would have more blinds than others.  The left most one might be "View" offering to change the view you have on the schedule.  Then more for creating events.  Does any of the existing toolkits offer such a widget?  JQuery-UI does have a "Blind" effect, which might do what I want.  There could also be a search box to the right of that.

On the question of sub-classing groups to create particular species of groups (Teaching Groups, Tutor Groups, Personal Groups etc.) I am inclined to make the actual clever group model (with all the nesting logic) merely shadow all the actual entities which people think of as groups - much like the Resource model never gets instantiated on its own in Markbook.  It only exists as an adjunct to a Person, or a TeachingGroup, or a Location etc.  Even its name exists only by being provided by the actual entity.

I could make a Ruby module called GroupInstance or something like that, which you mix in to anything which needs a membership, and that would provide all the accessor methods.  Using duck typing, they could all then behave as if they were groups, but leave all the hard work to the underlying group objects.
