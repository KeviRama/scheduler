====== DJD Discussion ======
Created Friday 09 January 2015

DJD and I met towards the end of the Michaelmas term to talk about whether Scheduler was ready to supplant the existing platform for supplying the school calendar.  I said no, and we agreed that the existing platform would continue for the Lent term, with Scheduler shadowing it as far as possible.

I identified a short list of bits of functionality which would be needed for Scheduler to take over:

[ ] Retain the structure (categorisation) of events in the import from Calendar to Scheduler
[ ] Better dialogue for the entry of events - check existing Calendar
[ ] Textual search on events
[ ] List view of events (kind of needed for the textual search)
[ ] Tidy up the display - it has a few niggles and isn't polished
[ ] Category view - select events by type rather than by who/what is involved
[ ] Facilities for the bulk entry of events, without having to repeat typing

And as a step on the way there, I would like to:

[ ] Fully automate import from Calendar to Scheduler - every night.

In terms of information about events, we also identified the need to record.

[ ] Who entered an event into the system
[ ] Who is the organiser of the event
[ ] Group (rather than individual) ownership of events
[ ] Audit trail, plus an interface to examine it.
