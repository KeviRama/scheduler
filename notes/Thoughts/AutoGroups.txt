====== AutoGroups ======
Created Wednesday 06 August 2014

I can get the SB loader code, once it's finished its main processing, to create various automatic groups of pupils.  Some I've thought of are:

* All students
* All students by year
* All students by house
* All students by house and year
* All students of each subject by year

So we could have groups called:

"All students"
"3rd year", "4th year", "5th year", etc.
"School house", "Crescent house", etc.
"School house 3rd year", "School house 4th year", etc.
"3rd year maths", "3rd year English", "3rd year latin", etc.
