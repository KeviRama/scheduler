Links a User and an Element, indicating that the user currently has an interest in that Element.  Controls the display of events to a User in the schedule view.  Each User sees all events involving Elements in which he is Interested.

==== Fields ====

user_id		The id of the relevant user
element_id	The id of the relevant element
colour		The colour in which to display events
