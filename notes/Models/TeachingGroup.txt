====== TeachingGroup ======
Created Friday 30 May 2014

Although I intend this to function merely for teaching groups, it's difficult to tell these apart from general groups in SB's feed, so for now it's all the groups I get from SB.

I'm currently making no attempt to link them to subjects, although it should be straightforward later.  For now they're just lists of pupils.

==== Fields ====

name		string	Textual name of the group
era_id		integer	Id of the Era the group exists in
current		boolean	Is this group current (only current year's groups should show up in search).
source_id	integer	The id of the group in SB
