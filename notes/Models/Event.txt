====== Event ======
Created Friday 09 May 2014

Fields for an event:

body			text		Body text - description of the event
eventcategory_id	integer	Id of the event's event category.
eventsource_id	integer	Id of the event's event source.
owner_id		integer	Id of the event's owner.
starts_at			datetime	Start
ends_at			datetime	End
approximate		boolean	Flag indicating that the event's datetime is not precise.
non_existent		boolean	Flag indicating that the event does not exist (e.g. a lesson not happening due to
						  study leave).  These are useful for arranging invigilation.
private			boolean	Visible only to the owner.
reference_id		integer	These two exist so that an event can reference something else - for example
reference_type	string	an exam module.  Usually they are not used.


I have removed the "tentative" flag for now.  I believe the tentative quality which we need to apply is expressed more by whether all the commitments to the event have been approved.

Let's go with it like that.
