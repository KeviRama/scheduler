====== EventCategory ======
Created Friday 09 May 2014

Event categories specify groups of types of events.  Examples would be:

* Timetable events
* Sporting fixtures
* Key dates
* Concerts
* Calendar
* Exam
* Exam invigilation
* Duty
* INSET

This list is far from complete.

Each event category has a number of flags to control its behaviour.

Flags identified so far are:

* schoolwide		Appears on all users' schedules
* publish		Can be downloaded via ical.  If a user doesn't specify categories, all these are sent.
* public			Superseded by the "Calendar" property - can go.
* for_users		Likewise, superseded.  Replace with schoolwide.
* unimportant	Not important enough to prevent use for cover.
* can_merge		Events can be merged to provide cover.
* can_borrow		Events with multiple staff can lose staff to cover.
* compactable	When downloading "days" information, event can be compacted.
* deprecated		On its way out
* privileged		Can only be selected by privileged users.

There will be more.

There is also a numeric field called pecking_order, which is used to set the priority of events.  For instance, an individual teacher might be double-booked at a given time, with both a lesson and a year group assembly.  In this instance the lesson should appear in his timetable/calendar, superseding the assembly. 

Each event category also has a name, which needs to be unique.
