====== EventCategory ======
Created Friday 09 May 2014

Event categories specify groups of types of events.  Examples would be:

* Timetable events
* Sporting fixtures
* Key dates
* Concerts
* Calendar
* Exam
* Exam invigilation
* Duty
* INSET

This list is far from complete.

Each event category has a number of flags to control its behaviour.

Flags identified so far are:

* Schoolwide - appears on all calendars.  E.g. term dates.
* Publish - included in ical exports
* Public - appears on a calendar for non logged-in users.
* Forusers - Appears on calendar for logged-in users, even if they aren't involved.  E.g. break.
* Unimportant - not important enough to prevent use for cover.

There will be more.

There is also a numeric field called pecking_order, which is used to set the priority of events.  For instance, an individual teacher might be double-booked at a given time, with both a lesson and a year group assembly.  In this instance the lesson should appear in his timetable/calendar, superseding the assembly. 

Each event category also has a name, which needs to be unique.
