====== TutorGroup ======
Created Thursday 29 May 2014

Tutorgroups list all the pupils in a particular tutor's care.


Fields

name		string	Textual name of the tutor group (e.g. 3JHW)
house		string	Name of house
staff_id		integer	Id of the staff member responsible
era_id		integer	Id of the Era the group exists in
start_year	integer	The intended start year of boys in this group
current		boolean	Is this group current (only current year's groups should show up in search).


I don't anticipate having such a thing as an inactive tutor group, so "active" doesn't need to be a database field.  It can be implemented as a method.
