====== Request ======
Created Saturday 04 February 2017

Requests are pre-cursors to [[Commitment]] records.  They link together [[Event]] and [[Element]] records but indicate that the [[Commitment]] is not yet in place.  This could be for one of two reasons.

1. The requested resource needs approval from someone.  Currently this element of their functionality is not implemented.  Approvals are done by means of a flag in [[Commitment]] records.  The intention is that Request records will replace that way of working later on.
2. The [[Request]] is for a group of some kind, and the resulting [[Commitment]] record(s) will link not to the group, but to individual members of the group.  Thus a Request could be for a mini-bus (implemented as a group) and then the request would be fulfilled by creating a [[Commitment]] record which allocated a specific member of the mini-bus group. [[Request]] records can also specify a quantity (possibly 0) so a [[Request]] might be for 3 members of staff to do invigilation.  This would result in three separate [[Commitment]] records, linking in the actual members of staff.

Each [[Commitment]] record created to fulfill a [[Request]] links back to the corresponding [[Request]] record.
