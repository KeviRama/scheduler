====== Ownership ======
Created Friday 17 July 2015

An Ownership record indicates responsibility of a given user for a specified element.  Typically this is used to link, for instance, the Amey Theatre staff as owners of the Amey Theatre locations.  It is also used to make the secretarial staff the owners of the Calendar resource.

==== Fields ====

user_id		Id of the relevant user
element_d	Id of the relevant element
equality		Boolean flag, indicating whether the element should be consider as being the user.
colour		The colour in which events relating to this ownership should be displayed.


To expand on the equality flag, a given person should have his or her User and Element records linked by an Ownership record with the quality flag set.  John Winters the User equals John Winters the Element.
