====== Staff ======
Created Tuesday 27 May 2014

The Staff record - any person who is a member of staff and might be associated with an event.

==== Fields: ====

id			Rails's id for the individual
name		Display name of staff member
initials		Initials of staff member
surname		Surname on its own
title			Title - e.g. Mr, Mrs, Miss, Dr
forename	Given name on its own
email		E-mail address
source_id	Id from the source system
active		Flag indicating whether the user is active 


These records will be created by means of an import from SB.  I anticipate this running nightly.  The import process will try to find a record with the right source_id.  If it can't find it will create it, and if it can find it it will update any fields which have changed.

The "active" field is special.  Since we can't be sure which records from SB are actually wanted, we will use a best-guess algorithm to set this field on initial record creation (Does the entry have an @abingdon.org.uk e-mail address?) but then leave it alone.  Maintenance on my system will let me set and unset it, and that setting will then persist through subsequent imports.

If active is not set, then the record will take play no part in subsequent searches etc.  Perhaps it could stop the staff member having an Element record?

Need the main key on the id field, plus an additional index on the source_id field.
