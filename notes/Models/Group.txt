====== Group ======
Created Wednesday 28 May 2014

The Group model is imported from Xronos, but it has some important changes.

The most significant of these is that it never exists on its own - it has no name field, and always exists attached to another record which specifies the actual type of the group - Tutorgroup or Teachinggroup initially.

I need a word for what the group record calls its associated record.  Parent?  Guardian?  Parent is not a good word because I already use that in the hierarchy of groups.  Go for visible_group for now.
