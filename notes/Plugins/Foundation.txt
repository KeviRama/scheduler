====== Foundation ======
Created Monday 28 April 2014

I am using Foundation version 5.0.  Instructions on how to install can be found at http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/applications.html but in essence you need to:

* Add "gem  'foundation-rails'" to your Gemfile and run bundle
* Do "rails g foundation:install"
