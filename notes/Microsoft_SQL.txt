====== Microsoft SQL ======
Created Sunday 25 May 2014

I need to do a bit of jiggery-pokery to access the SchoolBase data, which are held on a Microsoft SQL server.  I've been granted read access (only) to the relevant tables.

To do this, I need to install some additional tools on Linux.

I seem to have installed freetds-bin, freetds-common, freetds-dev, unixodbc and tdsodbc.  Then I created two configuration files:

tds.driver.template
'''
[FreeTDS]
Description = FreeTDS with protocol 7.2
Driver = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsodbc.so
'''

Note that this next file now includes the necessary specification of TDS_Version, which was missing to start with.  Discussion below of sorting out that problem.

tds.datasource.template
'''
[Schoolbase]
Driver = FreeTDS
Description = Accessing SchoolBase's database
Trace = No
Server = 172.16.0.47
Port = 1433
Database = Schoolbase
TDS_Version = 8.0
'''


and then added them in with:

'''
sudo odbcinst -i -d -f tds.driver.template
odbcinst -i s -f tds.datasource.template
'''


Note that the first one is done as root, whilst the second one is done as an individual user.

And then I seem to be able to connect with:

'''
isql -v Schoolbase winters trondheim
'''


Ah - found the error.  It is:

'''
[37000][FreeTDS][SQL Server]Unicode data in a Unicode-only collation or ntext data cannot be sent to clients using DB-Library (such as ISQL) or ODBC version 3.7 or earlier.
[ISQL]ERROR: Could not SQLExecute
'''


There's an article at http://www.ubuntitis.com/?p=64 which addresses this particular issue.  It references a helpful page at http://lucasmanual.com/mywiki/unixODBC which goes through the installation steps, and in particular makes it clear that you need "TDS_Version" at not "tds version" in your [[/etc/freetds/freetds.conf]] file.

Need a command which demonstrates the problem.

''select top 3 * from curriculum;''

seems to do it.  Now try changing the freetds.conf file.  Makes no difference - still can't do it.  Perhaps it should go in my datasource.template file?  Yes, it seems it should.  I can easily edit it, but how do I re-install it?

'''
odbcinst -u -s -n Schoolbase
odbcinst -q -s
'''


Seems to do it.  Now edit my template to add the protocol version (7.2) and re-install it.  Or perhaps I should use 8.0 as all the instructions say that.  Try 8.0.  And now I can retrieve my data.  Excellent.

Here's a magic incantation to dump the whole of a table to a file.

'''
john@mach2:~/testsql$ cat curriculum.sql 
select * from curriculum;
john@mach2:~/testsql$ isql Schoolbase winters trondheim -b -d, -q -c < curriculum.sql >curriculum.csv
'''
