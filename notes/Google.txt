====== Google ======
Created Tuesday 21 July 2015

The application uses Google authentication.  Some notes on how to set it up.

First you need to configure your host at:

https://console.developers.google.com/project/predictive-tree-611/apiui/credential?authuser=0#

Basically, it's the console at developers.google.com, then APIs and Auth and choose Credentials.

You need to create a new host with an origin of:

http://abingdon.scheduler.org.uk

and a redirect URI of:

http://abingdon.scheduler.org.uk/auth/google_oauth2/callback

then copy the Client ID and Client Secret thus created and put them in your user's .profile.  (The user as whom you're running the application) like this:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="the id which you copied"
GOOGLE_CLENT_SECRET="the secret which you copied"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

and restart the app.  You should now be able to log in through google.

28th Aug, 2016.  Something new.  It now seems that you need to enable the API before logging in will work.  There's an "Enable" button on the main dashboard page of the developer console.  I'm trying that, but there may be more needed too.  No - that seemed to be enough.
