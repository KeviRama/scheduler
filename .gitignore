# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp

# Ignore any files in the staging directory
/staging/*

# And any in the import directory
#
# I need an exception for the embedded README file.
#
# I don't want any files in the import directory.
# Except I do want the recurring directory therein.
# But I don't want any files within it.
# Except the README file.
#
/import/*
!/import/recurring
/import/recurring/*
!/import/recurring/README

/scratch/*

# Some zim files change too much
notes/.zim/*

# Ignore compiled assets
public/assets/*

# Ignore LetsEncrypt logs, but not the directory.
LetsEncrypt/logs/*
!LetsEncrypt/logs/.keep
# And likewise the config
LetsEncrypt/config/*
!LetsEncrypt/config/.keep
