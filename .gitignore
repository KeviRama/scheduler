# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp

# Ignore any files in the staging directory, except the one which keeps
# it there.
/staging/*
!/staging/.keep

# And any in the import directory
#
# I need an exception for the embedded README file.
#
# I don't want any files in the import directory.
# Except I do want the recurring directory therein.
# But I don't want any files within it.
# Except the README file.

#
#  And I want the basic Markbook directory structure
#
!/import/ForMarkbook
/import/ForMarkbook/*
!/import/ForMarkbook/README
#
#  And the basic iSAMS directory structure
#  There must be a simpler way of doing this.  What I want to do
#  is have the directory structure under git, but none of the
#  files which it contains.
