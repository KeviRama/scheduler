  
   Recurring events
  
    Any file in this directory with the extension .yml will be assumed
    to contain repeating events and will be parsed as such.  If it
    isn't valid it will be reported and ignored, but the other files will
    still be processed.
  
   The events are specified using YAML syntax with the ability to nest things
   so that common information does not need to be repeated.  Attributes
   can be specified in any order, but you need to give a minimal set in
   order to create a recurring event.
  
   At its simplest, you could just have:
   (Note the use of quotes around strings which might otherwise be
   misinterpreted.)
  
   category: Duty
   title:    "Coach park"
   starts:   "08:20"
   day:      Monday
  
   And then at least one of:
  
   staff:    JHW
   group:    "3rd year"
   location: "Amey Theatre"
   property: "Duty"
  
   If you don't specify any resources at all then there's no reason for
   the event to exist.
  
   And then you can also specify further attributes if required.
  
   start_date: 2016-09-06                Defaults to the loading date
   end_date:   2016-12-12                Defaults to the end of the current era
   ends:       "08:40"                   Defaults to the start time
   week:       A                         Defaults to both weeks (see footnote).
   greyed:     true                      Will be displayed greyed out.
   occurrence: first/
               second/
               third/
               fourth/
               fifth/
               last/
               penultimate/
               antepenultimate/
               all                       Restrict the event to happening on
                                         that/those days within a month.
                                         First Wednesday, last Tuesday etc.
   organiser:  JHW                       Initials of the staff member to
                                         be recorded as the organiser.
   note:       "This is a note\nattached to an event."
                                         Text string to be included in
                                         a note attached to the event.

   All the above will give you just one recurring event.  You can specify
   more than one by putting them in a YAML array, like this.
  
   - category:   Duty
     start_date: 2016-09-06
     end_date:   2016-12-12
     title:      "Coach park"
     starts:     "08:20"
     ends:       "08:40"
     day:        Monday
     staff:      JHW
   - category:   Duty
     start_date: 2016-09-06
     end_date:   2016-12-12
     title:      "Coach park"
     starts:     "08:20"
     ends:       "08:40"
     day:        Tuesday
     staff:      JPGB
  
   Note the - at the start of a line to indicate an entry in an array, and
   then all the items in the same entry have the same indentation.
   Structurally, this would be parsed as:
  
   [
     {
       category: Duty
       start_date: 2016-09-06
       ...
     },
     {
       category: Duty
       ...
     }
   ]
  
   But... there is clearly a lot of repeated information there.  It would be
   nice to cut that out, and you can do just that by nesting structures.
  
   category:   Duty
   start_date: 2016-09-06
   end_date:   2016-12-12
   title:      "Coach park"
   starts:     "08:20"
   ends:       "08:40"
   days:
   - day:        Monday
     staff:      JHW
   - day:        Tuesday
     staff:      JPGB
  
  
   What we have here now is a hash (key/value pairs) but then one entry
   in the hash (with the key "days") has as its value an array.  The
   array consists of further hashes which are each interpreted in the context
   of the outer hash.  You can go on doing this indefinitely, and it doesn't
   matter in which order you specify the attributes, as long as by the time
   you get to your inner-most hash, you've specified enough.
  
   The name of the key which you use to identify your inner array doesn't
   matter as long as it isn't one of the keys identified earlier.  Instead
   of "days" there we could equally have used "banana".  It makes sense to
   keep it reasonably meaningful though.
  
 
Footnote:

  The week: specification above is actually a string, with 3 meaningful
  characters.  "A", "B", and " ".  The default value for the string is "AB",
  meaning that the event will occur in both weeks A and B, but not outside
  term (when it is neither week A nor week B).  A space means the event should
  occur in weeks with no letter - i.e. the holidays.  Thus to make an event
  occur all the time regardless of term you specify week: "AB ".
