Four directories to handle data arriving from iSAMS.

PreFetched:
- this directory can be used to suppress the data fetching
behaviour of described for the following three directories.
If the necessary files are found here, then they are copied
from here instead of using the API and d/b access.

Incoming:
- is used as an initial repository as data are fetched.
Each time a fetch is scheduled to happen, this directory will
first be emptied and then the fetch will be run.
Provided the fetch appears to have been succesful, the files
are almost immediately moved to:

Current:
- once we are happy that we have a good new set of files in
Incoming, the files in Current are deleted and the files in
Incoming are moved to Current.  That way we always have a
good set in Current.  As soon as the move is done, we create
a new dated directory under:

Archive:
and copy the files from Current to that directory.  The copy
is done as soon as we have the files, rather than just before
we intend to replace them simply in order to make generating
the right date easier.  The files in Archive are then compressed
to save space.

Heirarchical directory naming - 2016/08/13/file.xml.gz etc.
