v0.2    2016-09-28

Changes:

* If a user has a resource selected for display but currently disabled -
  that is the tick-box is unticked - then adding the same resource a
  second time will cause it to be displayed.  This is because when a user
  has a lot of resources selected, he or she may not notice that the
  required one is already there.  The requirement is clearly to show
  it, so show it.

* Reduce notification e-mails.
  The system generates daily e-mails to approvers of resources reminding
  them about pending requests.  When checking for pending requests, the
  system was previously including rejected requests which could lead to
  empty reminder e-mails.  Now only generates e-mails about genuinely
  pending requests.

* Improve display of pending requests.
  Before a request for a resource has been approved, it does not appear
  in the general display for that resource.  Thus, if for instance someone
  has requested that an event be included in the calendar, it doesn't actually
  appear in the calendar until DJD has approved it.  It is however visible,
  greyed out, to DJD and any other approver.

  This led to a bit of confusion, in that the requester too couldn't see it
  in the context of the requested resource.  He or she could see it as
  one of "My events", and in the context of any of the other resources
  used, but not in the context of the one awaiting approval.  Unfortunately,
  some users were turning off all their display except for the requested
  resource and then getting puzzled at not being able to see the event.

  The rule now is: a pending request for a resource will be displayed in
  the context of that resource to:

    Approvers of the resource
    Admin users
    The original requester

* Various chronological development notes have been added in the notes
  directory.



v0.1    2016-09-26

The first release done under the GitFlow convention.  Very many things
happened before this release, but for calibration the last such change
was:

* Dump the entire timetable to a CSV file for analysis by OTL.
