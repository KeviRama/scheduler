v0.24.3 2017-09-05

* Group re-located lessons using a new property.

  In v0.23, a new facility was added whereby individual lessons could
  be relocated by users into different classrooms.  This release
  adds a new property - "Re-located" - which will automatically be
  added to all lessons so re-located.  It is then possible to view
  them or report on them as required.

* Make sure lessons can be re-located after editing.

  It's not a normal workflow, but there was a small bug in the
  re-location code.  If a user first edited an event, and then went
  back to the display screen, the re-location link no longer worked.
  It was necessary to close the dialogue and re-open it in order to
  do a re-location.  This bug has been fixed.

* Reports now understand covers/re-location

  The reporting code used to list cover staff and lesson re-locations
  simply as more resources on the event, without indicating their special
  status.  It now displays staff covers as "ABC (covering DEF)" and room
  re-locations as "G112 (normally G111)".

* The seed data for a new system has been enhanced to add the "Covered"
  and "Re-located" properties.


v0.24.2 2017-08-27

No changes to the application itself - just to the data importer.

* Cope with new staff not fully set up in iSAMS.

  One new member of staff had not been fully set up in iSAMS but
  nonetheless had been used as a form tutor, which caused the import
  utility to trip up.  Now copes with this situation.

* Cope with week letters missing from iSAMS.

  For schools with a two week timetable, iSAMS holds a record of
  which calendar week gets which of the two weekly timetables.  The
  importer uses this information to populate individual schedules.

  If that information is missing from iSAMS, the importer will now
  look at Scheduler's own database for events in the "Week letter"
  category, and if found will use that information instead.


v0.24.1 2017-08-25

* Fix to handling of conversion from timed to all-day

  The previous release introduced a change to edge-cases when converting
  existing events from being timed to being all-day.  Unfortunately the
  same change introduced a bug in the creation of new all-day events -
  they all ended up one day short.  This release fixes that bug.


v0.24   2017-08-07

* Configurable properties to show to new users

  When a new user registers on the system, the practice to date has been
  to include automatically all public calendars on the system as his or
  her immediate concerns.  For students (who can't add or delete concerns)
  this then becomes their fixed list of concerns.

  This release adds a little more flexibility, in that each Property
  within the system acquires two flags, controlling whether that Property
  will be included as an automatic concern for new staff or pupil users.

  It is thus possible to have a calendar which is not public, but is
  automatically shown to all new staff users, and not pupils (or vice
  versa).

  When this release is installed, all existing public calendars will
  get both these bits set, and from then on the system admin can set
  them as required.

* Correct display of edge case of timed multi-day events.

  If a timed multi-day event began at a time other than midnight and ended
  at exactly midnight, it was displayed as one day too long.  Now
  corrected.

* Improved handling of conversion to/from timed/all-day events.

  When a user changes an event from being timed to being all-day, or
  from being all-day to being timed, the default behaviour is now
  less surprising.

* New support file - setupmysql

  A new file has been added to the support area to help in the
  creation of MySql databases in a new installation.

* Import of iCal files

  Early versions of Scheduler included the means to import a set of
  calendar data from an old calendaring program which exported them
  as a CSV file.  Since the old calendaring program has gone away
  (its maker ceased trading a long time ago) this facility was disabled
  a while back.

  In this release, a similar facility is added in which allows the
  import of iCal files from Google Calendar.  It is thus possible to
  move over a whole existing school calendar from Google Calendar,
  allocating it an event category + property and getting it into
  Scheduler.

  Note that this is intended to be done on a one-off basis.  It
  includes no means to do an in-place update of such events.  If it's
  run a second time then all the events brought in in the first run
  will be deleted and re-created, losing any edits done to them
  subsequently.

  The facility is available only to the system administrator.


v0.23   2017-07-31

* Room covers (or lesson relocation)

  There are two common scenarios where a lesson needs to be re-located.

  1. The teacher wants to move to an ICT room or other specialized location.
  2. A lesson needs to be moved from its normal room to free that room
     up for another function.

  This release adds provision for users to make such relocations quickly
  and easily, and automatically prevents them choosing a room which isn't
  free.

  Lessons can be re-located by the teacher of the lesson, or by a
  specially privileged user of the system.  An extra privilege bit
  has been added to the user record for this purpose.

  To relocate a lesson, click on the lesson in the normal display,
  and then on the "Re-locate lesson" link.  This link appears only
  for users with the appropriate authority as described above.

  After a short delay (1-2 seconds) a pop-down menu is populated with
  a list of all the rooms which are free at the required time.  Selecting
  one and clicking OK will cause the lesson to be relocated.

  If the selected room requires approval, the usual process will be
  enforced, including e-mails if the administrator of the room has
  requested them.

  The same dialogue can be used to remove a re-location and revert the
  lesson to its original room.

  The mechanism implementing this behind the scenes is exactly the same
  as that used for cover for teachers, although it may not be immediately
  apparent to end users that they're really the same thing.

  The system adminstrator should set up a two-tier layer of groups
  to indicate which rooms can be used for cover.  Typically something
  like this:

  Cover Rooms ->  Able Building  -> A11
                                    A12
                                    A13
                  Baker Building -> B11
                                    B12
                                    B13
                  ICT rooms      -> ICT-A
                                    ICT-B

  A group of groups of rooms.  Once the "Cover Rooms" group exists, it
  can be configured for this purpose in the system settings.  Until that
  configuration is done, the "Re-locate lesson" link will not appear for
  any user.


v0.22.2 2017-07-31

* In the area of pre-formatted iCal feed URLs.

  For people (staff and pupils) a variety of feed options are offered,
  but for other elements there was just one.  This release changes that
  to two - one with breakthrough events and one without.  It's
  conceivable that either might be required by end users.


v0.22.1 2017-07-31

  Two small fixes

* Further fix to the auto-update of the pending requests count.  It turned
  out the permission checking was wrong, meaning that although the
  feature worked, it worked only for admin users.  Now corrected so that
  it will work for anyone.

* The consistency check in the Commitment model was slightly wrong, in that
  any time a Commitment record was validated, it caused the corresponding
  Event and Element records to be validated too.  This was caused by a
  misunderstanding about the meaning of the declaration of the relationship
  between the two.  There is no reason for the Commitment model to be
  attempting to validate the other two, so the relevant declaration has
  been removed.


v0.22   2017-07-25

* Issue a warning for events with no resources

  The most common mistake which new users make is to create an event
  but give it no resources at all.  They are then puzzled as to why
  no-one can see it.

  The system will now display a large warning message as soon as they
  save an event with no resources.

* Warn if rooms or people are double-booked.

  Similarly, the system now checks whilst a user is adding resources
  to an event, and highlights any people or locations which are explicitly
  double-booked.  That is - have a direct commitment to an overlapping
  event.

  This feature won't pick up indirect commitments - via a group - so
  it won't tell you if the student you want is in a lesson.  This is
  too computationally expensive to perform on the fly, but the existing
  flagging of clashes should pick these up and put a red dot on the
  lessons.

  The main purpose of this is to point out to people that the ICT room
  (or whatever) which they've attempted to book is already booked
  by someone else.


v0.21   2017-07-21

* Provide ical feeds by UUID

  Originally, ical feeds were specified by staff initials, then later by
  element ID allowing feeds to be taken for any element, not just staff.
  This is slightly insecure in that element IDs are allocated sequentially,
  so any reasonably small integer would result in some sort of feed
  although it was impossible to predict what you'd get.

  This release adds a random UUID to each element record and ical feeds
  can now be requested by UUID as well.  For security, the system administrator
  can choose to turn off the previous methods, meaning only the UUID one
  will work.  Guessing a UUID is pretty much impossible.

* Pre-formatted ical feed URLs.

  Since UUIDs are long and potentially very boring to type, the system
  now also provides pre-formatted feed URLs which can be copied to the
  user's clipboard and then pasted into whatever calendar program is in
  use.  These will be found on each element's "Concern" page - accessed
  by clicking on one of the coloured boxes down the left hand side of
  the page.

  Several different URLs are provided for each item, allowing them to get
  all their events in one go, or split out such things as cover and
  invigilation.  This means they can choose to display these items in
  a different colour from their normal events.

  Additional system settings have been provided to allow the system
  adminstrator to set the base URL to use, and whether the URLs should
  begin "http:" or "https:".

* Split concerns page into tabs.

  With the addition of the URLs to the existing page about each Concern,
  the length of the page became excessive.  It has been split into several
  tabs to make it easier to use.


v0.20.6 2017-06-30

* Display staff initials on invigilation (and other) events.

  At the request of Abingdon School, it is now possible to switch
  on the display of staff initials for events in the main calendar
  display.  This is done on a per-concern basis and defaults to off.

  Note that it will display only staff directly connected to the event.
  Staff indirectly connected by way of a group membership will not
  be included (far too computationally expensive).
  
  The primary function is to enable a quick view of who is doing
  each invigilation slot, but it may also be of use to students wanting
  to see who is teaching each lesson.

  To switch on, click on the relevant concern in your left hand column
  and tick the "List teachers" box.  You can also set it to default to
  on by clicking on your user name (top right) and ticking the box
  there.  Any new concerns you create will then have the box pre-ticked.

* Fix to auto-update of pending requests count.

  The URL used to auto-update a user's pending request count was slightly
  wrong, meaning it worked only if the user was on the main screen.
  This has now been corrected so it will work anywhere.

* Fix to testing environment.

  The request notification code implemented in the previous release had
  an edge case which cannot arise in the development or production
  environments but can be triggered in the test environment where things
  are potentially done out of sequence.  Specifically - attempting to
  update an event without first starting to edit it.  This led to one
  test failing.  The code has been fixed so the test no longer fails.


v0.20.5 2017-06-21

* Add reply-to to invigilation e-mails.

  The system generates e-mails to warn people when they have invigilation
  slots.  Some users reply to these without thinking, which has no useful
  result if it goes to the system.

  Added a reply-to field so that such replies will go to a real person.


v0.20.4 2017-06-20

* Notify impatient users of request cancellations.

  Some time ago a facility was added whereby users who control resources
  could request instant e-mails each time someone put in a request for
  that resource.  It's an opt-in facility, controlled by a flag in
  the user record.

  This release adds the means to notify the same users if a pending
  request is cancelled - either because the requester deletes the
  individual request, or because the whole corresponding event has
  been deleted.  Note that this happens only for requests which have
  not yet been approved.

  It is controlled by the same flag in the user record, so you can't
  choose to have one and not the other.

  Note that the notification e-mails are sent out only at the end of
  an event-editing session.  A user can add and remove the same resource
  as often as he likes during one edit and no e-mails will be sent.
  Only when the user clicks "Update" does the system send either
  kind of e-mail.

* Update pending request count in the main screen.

  Resource administrators get a count of outstanding requests, "(4)"
  and the like in their top menu bar.  Until now, this was updated
  each time they interacted with the application, but not otherwise.

  This release adds a 5 minute update.  Every 5 minutes the front end
  polls the back end to see if the count has changed, and if it has then
  it updates the display.


v0.20.3 2017-06-16

* Remove date/time from heading in invigilation notification e-mail.

  It was unnecessary and confusing.  Removed.


v0.20.2 2017-06-09

* Add an indicator of the time.

  A long-standing request that turns out now to be very easy.
  Add a little red line showing the current time.


v0.20.1 2017-06-07

* Fix settings dialogue.

  A small error was discovered which got into the system at v0.19.
  It prevented the system administrator from accessing the global
  system settings dialogue.  This release fixes that problem.

  
v0.20   2017-06-06

* This release implements filters in the main schedule display.

  Users can now choose to reduce what they see by filtering out events
  by event category.  If they have any filter in effect then a red marker
  appears at top left to remind them that it is on.

  Administrators can also add in event categories which would not
  otherwise be visible - those with the visible flag not set.  In a
  default installation this is just the "Hidden" event category.
  This can be useful in order to track down inivisible events belonging
  to another user.

* The sort order for multiple events at the same time has been improved.

  Prior to the last release, concurrent events were displayed in alphabetical
  order.  In the last release this was changed to have them displayed in
  order of the relevant resource.  Now both are used - they are sorted
  first by resource and then alphabetically.


v0.19   2017-05-22

* The main change in this release is that the version of FullCalendar
  used has been updated to the latest available - 3.4.0.  Previously
  Scheduler was using 2.0.2.  This has enabled various other enhancements.

* When events are being viewed for multiple resources, the left-to-right
  ordering has historically been by alphabetical ordering of event title.
  This can lead to a less than clear display.  From this release, the
  left to right ordering is dictated by the resource involved, so resource
  A's events will always be to the left of resource B's events, etc.

* It is now possible for the system adminstrator to enter period times in
  the system and for these then to be displayed to individual users as
  background events (pale shaded areas) on the display.  More than one
  set can be entered (e.g. for a main school and a junior school) and
  each user can choose which to see.

* If a user has period times switched on and the user then tries to
  create a new event within a configured period - either by clicking
  within a period or by dragging a resource onto the calendar - then
  the default times for the new event will now default to the period's
  times.  Clicking and dragging to create a new event with duration is
  not affected and will continue to work as before.

* The framing of the calendar has been tightened up and the user should
  no longer find that there are two simultaneous scroll bars.  The calendar
  resizes as far as it can to fit the user's chosen window size.

* A new view is available in the calendar display.  Called simply "list"
  it provides a nicely formatted list of all the chosen events in a month.

* The automated test suite for the application had fallen rather behind
  developments.  It has been updated and now runs without error.


v0.18.6 2017-04-09

  Two small fixes

* Handle duplicate staff initials in ical feed.

  It is possible to request an ical feed for a member of staff by
  specifying either the staff member's element ID (the preferred
  way) or for reverse compatibility with an earlier implementation,
  by specifying the staff member's initials.  The latter failed
  if the school configured two members of staff with the same initials.
  The system would always pick the first such member of staff, which
  generally would be someone who had left.

  The database query has been enhanced to specify "current: true"
  in addition to the existing criteria, so as to pick the later
  member of staff.

  This has the side effect that it is no longer possible to get an
  ical feed for an ex-member of staff by means of his or her initials.
  If you really need that, then use the element ID.

* Re-position invigilation flag in some views

  When handling invigilation slots, the system shows the status of
  each slot with a little red/yellow/green flag.  In some views this
  ended up in a less than ideal place.

  This release adds view-specific code to position the flag to be
  visible in each view, and as far as possible, not to cover up other
  information.


v0.18.5 2017-04-30

  Still drawing together strands and tidying up.

* Update the seed data used for new installations and the demo system
  adding items to enable the demonstration of the full facilities
  of resource requests.

* A new flag on the reporting page allows control of whether or
  not entries should end with a full stop.

  When the legacy calendar data were imported into Scheduler in its
  first school, the entries were rather a mess.  Some had a full stop,
  some didn't, and at least one ended in "  ."  (Two spaces and then
  a full stop.)  To produce a consistent report for printing, the
  reporting code massaged all the entries to end in a single correctly
  positioned full stop.

  Now Scheduler is in use in another school, and they would prefer
  not to have the full stop, so it's now a configurable item on
  the report generation page.  Once you've made a choice it will
  be remembered and used by default on subsequent runs.


v0.18.4 2017-04-30

  Quite a bit of code tidying has been done in this release to
  facilitate the imminent migration to the latest version of
  FullCalendar.

  Code for preparing events and sending them to FullCalendar in
  the front end used to be spread between the Event model and the
  Events controller.  It has now all been moved to a Service Object
  and unified.  The number of entrypoints in the JavaScript module
  which drives FullCalendar has been greatly reduced, and the code
  has been simplified.

  Actual changes visible to the end user are:

* When a resource attached to an event requires approval, it is also
  possible for the resource administrator to set up what is called
  a Prompt Note.  This prompts the end user to provide additional
  information relating to the request - e.g. ancillary information
  about catering.  In previous releases, the software did not
  always set this up correctly.  Provided the user simply added the
  resource to an event then all was well, but if the user dragged the
  resource onto the calendar, or set up the resource to auto-add to
  new events then the note did not get added.  It now gets added in
  all circumstances.

* Such notes are now visible only to the requester and the resource
  administrator unless the requester chooses to make them more
  generally visible.

* Scheduler allows the user to set up two kinds of events - timed
  events and all-day events.  All-day events appear across the top of
  the display and last an integer number of days.  Timed events appear
  in the main area of the display and have a specific start and end time.

  It is possible to enter a timed event which lasts more than one day.
  E.g. starting at 08:30 on Monday 1st, and running to 16:30 on
  Tuesday 9th.  Until now this resulted in a vertical coloured block
  running through every day's display for that period.  More than a
  couple of these made the display look very messy.  This has not been
  a problem at Abingdon because multi-day events have always been
  entered without times (or perhaps, users learned to do that to keep
  the display clean).

  At Dean Close school however, it is desired to put the events in with
  times, and so Scheduler's display code has been made a little more
  intelligent.  Where a timed event lasts more than one day it will be
  displayed in the all-day section of FullCalendar's display (at the
  top) but with the start time pre-pended to the first part of
  the event's display.  Thus for the example above, the event would
  appear as running from Monday to Saturday in the first week, with
  "(08:30) " before its name, and then from Sunday to Tuesday in
  the second week, without the extra time field.


v0.18.3 2017-04-27

  Another two tiny fixes to problems which became apparent during
  testing of currently ongoing development work.

* When a user is creating an event, the date/time fields provide
  a pop-up box allowing the information to be entered by means of
  clicks etc.  (Or the date/time can be entered simply by typing text.)

  When editing an existing event the same facility should be available
  but wasn't.  This release re-instates that missing functionality.

* It is possible that a user will try to add a concern to the left
  hand column even though the relevant item is already there but
  un-ticked.  In this circumstance the natural thing for the program to
  do is simply to tick the existing item and update the display.

  This is what it now does.


v0.18.2 2017-04-26

* A hotfix to a typo in the UserMailer object.

  All attempts to confirm requests for resources were failing because
  of a typo (missing letter) in the user mailer.  This release corrects
  that problem.


v0.18.1 2017-04-22

  Some more tidying up following on from yesterday's big tidy up.
  The tidier things get, the more obvious the remaining items become.

* Each installation needs its own secret key for securing the sessions
  between browser and server.  This is a long pseudo-random hex string
  generated using the command "rake secret" in the application's root
  directory.

  Up until now, each installation has had its unique secret edited into
  the file config/secrets.yml, which is the wrong way to do it.

  From this release, the secret goes in ~/.profile, and the config/secrets.yml
  file picks it up from the environment, meaning that the same file
  can be used on all installations.  This is how it should always have been
  done.

* The file utils/checkclashesahead existed in a slightly different
  (corrected) form on Abingdon's installation but not in the main
  repository.  Pulled back into the main repository.

* Likewise the file lib/import/school/permitted_overloads.rb on
  Abingdon's installation differed from the main repository.  Pulled
  back in.


v0.18   2017-04-21

* Improved the iSAMS data import code to cope with more than one school.

  The original implementation of Scheduler imported timetable data
  from a single-school MIS called Schola.  It did this by taking
  all the individual staff and pupil timetables and from them
  reconstructing the complete timetable and set lists.

  The next implementation imported data from SchoolBase by means of
  direct access to SchoolBase's database tables.  This version of
  the importer still exists, but it's a single large (5100 line)
  Ruby program.  It would need tweaking to work for a different school.

  The next requirement was to import timetables from iSAMS and the
  opportunity was taken to re-write the importer as a modular
  implementation.  It now consists of 41 separate Ruby source
  files plus a few specific to each school each of which does
  a separate specific task.  They are split into three hierarchical
  groups in separate directories:

    * General code regardless of MIS (18 source files)
    * iSAMS-specific code (23 source files)
    * School specific code (varies - 3 - 7 files)

  There remains the task of taking the SchoolBase importer mentioned
  above and adding it in to this new structured implementation.

  Although the code above was always intended to work with more than
  one school, the acid test came when it was time to install it at
  its second school.  Overall the results were good, but a small
  amount of cleaning up was required.  Some code was in the iSAMS
  area which should have been in the School area, and a false
  assumption (that the three-letter abbreviation of Thursday is
  always "Thu") came to light.

  This release pulls together all the tweaks into a version which has
  been tested to work well at both the current iSAMS-using schools.

  When doing a new installation, or installing this release for the
  first time, it is necessary to go into the directory:

  ~/Work/Coding/scheduler/lib/import/school

  and type "./linkup <School name>" in order to pick the right
  school-specific code files.


v0.17.5 2017-04-14

* And do exactly the same for the LetsEncrypt config files


v0.17.4 2017-04-14

* Ignore the LetsEncrypt log files

  Continuing the theme of tidying things up, the only thing which
  changes here is the .gitignore file.  It now specifies that the
  contents of the directory LetsEncrypt/logs should be ignored, although
  the directory itself should be kept.


v0.17.3 2017-04-14

A bit of a drawing together of a few loose strands.

* Don't complain about inconsistent data from the iSAMS database.

  It's becoming steadily more apparent that the iSAMS database lacks
  basic consistency constraints.  We're getting membership records
  for pupils which are apparently currently active, even though the
  corresponding groups are currently inactive.  Stop complaining
  about them.

* In the course of testing the above, an instance of a hard coded
  path was found in the script which invokes the import process.
  An appropriate environment variable already exists, so the script
  was amended to test for it and then use it.

* The seed data used for setting up new systems and the demo system
  has been enhanced to include information relevant to invigilation.
  For the demo system, a period of suspended lessons is created to
  allow the feature to be demonstrated.


v0.17.2 2017-04-10

* Add the means to edit the number of invigilators per room.

  Previously one set a default number of invigilators for an exam
  cycle and this propagated to all the invigilation slots.  Each slot
  could then be amended individually, but there was no way to do it
  for all the slots in a room.

  It is now possible to set a default for the exam cycle, which will
  be copied as the default for each new room record but can be amended
  in the course of creating the room record, or later.

  If the number for a room is altered after the actual invigilation
  events have been generated then a re-generation of the events will
  alter the individual invigilation event records provided:

    1. The individual record has no invigilators allocated
    2. The individual record has not been set to 0.

  The idea is to preserve information which has been actively entered,
  whilst allowing bulk changes where possible.

* Fix a bug whereby events which were moved did not change name.

  In the original implementation, all invigilation events were called
  simply "Invigilation".  This was later changed to "<Room no> Invigilation".
  Thus one would have, for instance, "M116 Invigilation", the idea
  being to make it really obvious to the end user where he or she
  was meant to be.

  If however a set of invigilations were moved to a new room, the
  name did not change.  The event would continue to be called
  "M116 Invigilation" even though it was now in M115.  This release
  fixes that problem.


v0.17.1 2017-04-06

* Add the means to check for events clashing with invigilation slots.

  These can arise either because the exams administrator has over
  ridden the list of free staff being offered, or because other
  events have been added since the invigilation slots were populated.

  The report can be displayed on screen, or e-mailed users flagged as
  being exam adminstrators.  The latter can be done automatically as
  part of the overnight processing.

* Exam processing has been renamed as Invigilation processing, since
  that's what it actually deals with.  As a result, the documentation
  is now at:

    https://xronos.uk/invigilation.html


v0.17   2017-03-22

* This release implements a major new feature - exam invigilation.

  For details on how to use it, see the on-line documentation at:

    https://xronos.uk/exams.html

  When installing this version, it is necessary to migrate the
  database (rake db:migrate) re-compile the assets (rake assets:precompile)
  restart the application, and then edit the system settings to add
  the system's domain name and source e-mail address.


v0.16.1 2017-02-27

There are no code changes in this release, just a change to this
release notes file and the version number.  One item got missed
from yesterday's release notes file.

* Re-check user records at login to see if they match a known person.

  Up until this release, when the system encountered a new user logging
  on it checked to see if the user's e-mail address matched that of a
  staff member or a pupil.  If it did then the two were linked and the
  user was treated as a proper user.  Otherwise it was treated much the
  same as if it wasn't logged on at all.

  A problem arose from this, in that it could happen that a user logged
  on before the corresponding staff or pupil record had been created.
  The user record would be created without a link, and would be treated
  ever after as a guest.  It was necessary to delete the user record
  and let it be created again in order to establish the link.

  As of this release, guest users are checked every time they log in to
  see whether a matching staff or pupil record has sprung into existence.
  If it has, then the two are linked, and the user changes status from
  being a guest to being a proper user.


v0.16   2017-02-26

* Adds support for creating a new installation from scratch.  After
  initialising an empty database, seed data will provide the minimal
  records needed to get going.

* Allow multiple public calendars.
  Previous versions assume that just the calendar called "Calendar" is to
  be public.  This worked fine at Abingdon School, but Dean Close School
  want three public calendars - main school, prep school and pre-prep
  school.  The system now allows an arbitrary number of public
  calendars, and which ones are public is controlled by a flag on the
  relevant property.

  If an installation has 0 or 1 public calendars then the display shown
  to non-logged-on users will be exactly the same as before.  If there
  are 2 or more public calendars then even users who aren't logged on
  will get a column down the left hand side where they can pick which ones
  they want to see.  They still can't add or remove anything from this
  list, but they can switch them off and on.

* The login method to be used is now configurable.
  There is a new item under the Settings menu allowing different kinds
  of login to be used.  The default remains "Google login" which was
  the only one before.  The only new one which has been implemented
  is "Demo mode", which allows anyone with a Google account to log in.
  This is used on the demonstration system.

* It is now possible to choose a preferred colour for the public
  calendar(s), instead of it/them always being green.


v0.15.4 2017-02-15

* Remove spurious column in user panel at LHS.


v0.15.3 2017-01-18

* Allow recurring events to be specified on the first Wednesday, second
  Thursday, last Friday etc. of a month.  Also allow events to be specified
  outside term time.

  For full info, see import/recurring/README


v0.15.2 2017-01-09

* Improve diagnostics when parsing recurring event files.

  One of the diagnostic messages produced when an error was found in
  a recurring events file was difficult to understand when taken in
  isolation.  This release improves the wording to make it clearer.


v0.15.1 2017-01-05

* Fix suspension status of assembly shared between year groups.

  The code to suspend lessons based on the suspension records in the database
  was looking at only the first group of pupils attached to the event.
  This was fine for lessons (where there is just the one group) but
  produced a slightly erroneous result for assemblies.  The obvious
  example was the 4th + 5th year assembly on 16th January, which was
  suspended because of the 5th year mocks.

  The code now checks *all* the groups attached to the event and suspends
  the event only if all the affected year groups have a suspension record.


v0.15   2016-12-22

* Show membership records for groups.

  The membership of groups has got quite interesting, in that iSAMS makes
  an attempt to handle the duration of memberships for activity groups
  (but not other groups).  Unfortunately, it throws away historical
  information so a certain amount of caution is needed in the data import.

  To enable a clearer view of what exactly is going on, element display
  for groups now shows not just the current and historical members, but
  also all the individual membership records (on a separate tab) so one
  can see the detail of what is going on.  Some OH groups now have
  *future* members - members who will be in the group when the new term
  starts.

  This has involved a complete re-work and simplification of all the
  panels in the element display screens.

* Clash checking has been enhanced in two ways.

  1) The events to be checked are now driven by a flag on the
     eventcategory record, where previously they were hard-coded to
     be Lesson and Other Half events.

  2) Suspended (non-existent) events are not clash-checked, but it
     was possible for an event to be clash-checked - and acquire
     a note and flag - and then later to be suspended.  The code will
     now spot such an event and remove the note/flag and the next clash
     checking run.

* It has become apparent that the iSAMS database can become inconsistent
  in the area of cover records.  Currently it contains nearly 300 cover
  records with no corresponding lessons.  The importer now reports
  merely a count of such records rather than logging each one individually.
  (If you want them logged individually, remove the --quiet switch from
  the invocation of the utility.)

* An error has been fixed in the area of Other Half groups which were
  loaded from iSAMS with an end date already in place.  On the appropriate
  date (the day after the indicated end date) the groups should have been
  marked as no longer current in Scheduler.  This was not happening and
  the loader has been corrected so now it does.


v0.14.1 2016-12-13

* Gnashum, frashum, Dick Dasterdly.  One little unwanted <br> snuck through.


v0.14   2016-12-13

* Add a multicover flag to staff records.

  Under certain circumstances, one wants to be able to assign the same
  person (possibly not a real person) to do more than one cover at the
  time, or do to a cover when apparently involved in something else.

  This release adds a multicover flag to the staff record.  Anyone
  with this flag set will not generate warnings if over-committed for
  cover.

* Updated permitted_overloads.rb

  The permitted_overloads.rb file in the system was heavily out of
  date and thus ineffectual.  This new one does more useful work.


v0.13.2 2016-12-01

* Correction to previous release.

  The previous release was checking the value of the active for each
  member of staff as calculated by the loader.  It should have been using
  the value stored in the database.  It is possible for the former to
  be false and the latter to be true (but not the other way around) as
  indeed does happen when a member of staff doesn't really exist but
  needs to be covered.  This is used for setting up Invigilation.


v0.13.1 2016-11-30

* Add an extra check on cover of inactive staff.

  iSAMS doesn't really understand the concept of invigilation, so it's
  been done by setting up dummy lessons with dummy members of staff and
  then arranging cover for them.  The dummy members of staff weren't
  active, which caused the cover importer to trip over the relevant
  records.

  Said members of staff now are flagged as active, but this release
  fixes the importer so it won't have the same problem in future.


v0.13   2016-11-29

* Removed "New user" button from user list screen, since it didn't actually
  work and it's not how users are created.

* The dialogue box on the top of the left hand column in the main scheduler
  screen now auto-submits when the user selects a value.  It's not obvious
  to the casual user that this is implemented as a form (with just the
  one visible field) so some were baffled as to how to submit it.

* In the event editing screen, the field to add resources to the event
  now has an "Add" button to the right of it, for those who prefer to have
  something on which to click.

* A significant re-work of the facilities for looking up user records,
  including the addition of a "Search" box in order to jump straight
  to a particular user.


v0.12   2016-11-21

* Added edit_all_events and subedit_all_events to user records.

  Two new flags on the user record which can be set and cleared by
  administrators.  The former allows a user to edit any event in the
  system as if he or she was the owner.  The latter works similarly
  except it confers only sub-editing capability - as if the user
  was the organiser.


v0.11.2 2016-11-18

* A little wrinkle arose in the iSAMS data import this morning.  A new
  node has been added to the Day node under the Week specifications.
  Nodes are nested as follows:

    <Structure>
      <Week>
        <Days>
          <Day>
            <Periods>
              <Period>


  but the new node has been added in parallel to Periods and with the
  name <Day>, giving:

        <Days>
          <Day>
            <Day>
            <Periods>

  which isn't invalid XML, but is more than a little odd.  The loader
  was looking inside <Days> for <Day> and finding it more than once.

  The XML import code has been tightened up to ignore the inner <Day>
  node (which has a completely different meaning from its parent).

* In the course of diagnosing the above problem, a left-over debug
  message was found in app/models/element.rb and removed.


v0.11.1 2016-11-17

* A slight error in the previous release meant that ordinary users could
  no longer create events.  Once they'd created them, they could edit them,
  but they couldn't put in the minimal information needed to create them.


v0.11   2016-11-17

* Added the means for event organisers to be enabled as sub-editors.

  Because Abingdon's live database contains a lot of events - particularly
  calendar events and sports fixtures - which have been entered by one
  individual rather than by their organisers, a means is needed to allow
  the organisers to attach team lists to the events.  Such lists are
  easily generated in iSAMS and then migrate over to Scheduler automatically.

  This release adds the facility whereby the individual listed as an
  organiser can do minor editing of the event, even though he or she
  does not own it and would not otherwise have permission.  Changing
  the title or time is not permitted, but adding and removing resources
  (except those subject to the approvals process) is.

* An extra batch job has been added to look further ahead when checking
  for lesson absentees.  It is intended to be run in the evening and by
  default looks ahead by 2 weeks, and then processes 4.  This means it
  will always slot in just after the main job which process 2 weeks.


v0.10.4 2016-11-16

* Fix a bug in the group loading code, whereby a public group was not
  correctly flagged as being available to all users.

* Add a maintenance method to fix the 8 groups currently in the system
  which have this problem.


v0.10.3 2016-11-15

* By the use of a cache, the clash checking processing has been speeded
  up by a factor of approximately 4.  This means it now easily fits
  in the available time slot.

* The overnight run now defaults to processing 2 weeks - the current
  week and the following one.

* All day events now show as "all day" in the clash check reports, rather
  than as "00:00 - 00:00" as they did before.

* There is an extra option on the clash check utility "--ahead N" which
  allows it to be run N weeks ahead.  By default and without this option
  it starts with the current week.

* A small fix has been applied to the code which selects notes for display.
  Normally this is done simply on the basis of whether a user is staff,
  pupil or other, but some users (those who approve commitments) can get
  to see extra.  A slight error in the d/b query code (an INNER JOIN which
  should have been a LEFT JOIN) meant that in exceptional circumstances
  such users failed to be shown the odd note which they should have seen.


v0.10.2 2016-11-12

* At Niki's request, changed the default for staff to have permission
  to create public groups.  Ran a command line task
  ("User.set_initial_permissions") to give all existing staff this
  permission bit.


v0.10.1 2016-11-11

* The sole change here is to this release notes file.

  The double-booking code can also notify staff by e-mail of clashes
  which have been identified.  By default it doesn't, but staff can
  choose to receive notifications in three ways.  There are new flags
  on the user record, and they edit them by clicking on their name
  on the top right of the screen in the usual way.  Admin users can
  also edit them on behalf of other users.

  a) Immediate notification.

     The user gets a notification at the end of the clash-checking run
     of anything which has changed and affects his or her lessons.

  b) Daily notification.

     The user gets a daily e-mail of upcoming clashes.

  c) Weekly notification.

     The user gets a weekly summary e-mail of upcoming clashes.


v0.10   2016-11-11

* Add a favicon.ico file with something in it, plus similar files for
  Apple devices which want an icon for their desktops.

* Checking and flagging double-booking of students.

  This is a major new feature which was always intended to be one of the
  main points of Scheduler.  Provided you store all your schedule information
  in one central place (Scheduler) you can then automatically flag up
  apparent double-bookings.  This in turn means that staff can potentially
  be told automatically when individual students are going to be missing
  from their lessons.

  The processing is fairly compute intensive (1-2 hours to process 1
  week of data) so needs to be run overnight.  Cron jobs are included to
  do the work.

  Where such clashes are identified, the affected lessons are flagged with
  a red marker in the main Scheduler display.  Clicking on the lesson
  will then display full details of who is likely to be missing and why.
  This information is visible to staff only - pupils will see neither
  the red marker nor the explanatory note.

  Scheduler can work only on the information which it has.  Music lessons
  for instance are not entered into Scheduler and so will not be handled
  by the clash checker.  As soon as they are entered, they will be checked
  in the same way.

  There are also currently some false positives caused by inaccurate
  data having been entered - e.g. on Thu 17th Nov, an all-day event has
  been entered entitled, "Product Design in Action, Warwick University".
  Unfortunately, it has been entered as involving the whole of the sixth
  form which it probably doesn't.  As for any trip, a custom group
  should be created in iSAMS, and then attached to the event.  Once this
  becomes the normal way of working the clash information will become
  fully accurate.  The existing analysis of this event is still useful,
  because it will at least flag the existence of the event to teaching
  staff.

  The flags should also serve to polish and correct the Other Half
  activity lists.  Quite a few pupils seem to be booked for two
  simultaneous OH activities.


v0.9.1  2016-11-10

* A hotfix for a problem which wasn't causing any issues from the users'
  point of view, but which led to errors in the log file.

  When a user is adding resources to event, he or she can potentially
  send back an empty field, or an invalid name, for the selected resource.
  This was leading to an error in the back end, because it did its checks
  in the wrong order.  Nothing appeared out of place to the user, but
  it made for a messy error log.

  Now checks for non-existent elements before attempting permission
  checks.


v0.9    2016-11-04

* Just one extra feature.  Administrators can now edit users' concerns
  through the GUI, rather than having to fall back to the command line.
  This is generally used to give (or take away) extra permissions
  for the user relating to an item - e.g. to give a user control
  of events using a specified resource.

  To use this, go to Menu => Users and choose Show for your required
  user.  This will give a list of his or her current concerns, and then
  you can click "Edit" next to the one which you want to change.

  Note that the names of a couple of flag fields in the underlying
  database are slightly misleading.  In the database, these are called
  "owns" and "controls".  They work as follows:

  "owns" means the user approves requests for a resource.  Any resource
  with one or more such user will need to go through the approvals
  process when requested.  In the GUI, this is labelled as "Control"
  because that's what the user is really doing.

  "controls" is an extra permission bit, intended for maintenance of
  events.  If a user has this bit set on a concern, then he or she can
  edit any event which uses that resource.  This appears in the GUI as
  "Edit any".


v0.8    2016-11-03

* As noted in the release notes for v0.7, the improved visibility of
  group membership in that release led to the detection of a long standing
  problem.  Where pupils are removed from the school in iSAMS, but not
  from their corresponding groups, then later removals failed to
  propagate into Scheduler.

  The algorithm for removing pupils from groups in Scheduler has now
  been corrected, and it will remove them even if they no longer
  appear in iSAMS's list of current pupils.


v0.7.1  2016-10-28

* Purely cosmetic change.  Puts resources for an event in the event
  display screen back into columns.


v0.7    2016-10-28

* It is now possible to view all locations which have an administrator.
  Use Menu => Models => Locations => Owned to get a list, each of which
  can then be viewed in detail.

* Subjects are now loaded into the Scheduler database as objects which
  can be displayed.  All lessons, teachers and teaching groups are linked
  to their corresponding subjects.  It is therefore possible to display
  all the lessons for a particular subject in the calendar view, or to
  generate a report for any chosen subject.

* Teaching groups are now linked not only to their subjects, but also
  to all their teachers, meaning you can see who teaches each group
  without having to scan the group's schedule.

* Added general display facilities for all elements, allowing detailed
  information to be obtained on any student, staff member, room etc.
  This facility is available only to members of staff - not to pupils.
  The display pages link together, so you can look at a teaching set, then
  at any of its students, then at any of his OH groups, etc.  Access to
  this linking is controlled by a flag (can_roam) on the user account.
  This flag is currently set to true only for users identified as staff.

* The above general display can be accessed either by clicking on an
  element being monitored in the left hand column and choosing "Full details",
  or by clicking on any event, and then on an element being used by that
  event.  Un-privileged users (e.g. students) can view only their own
  personal details.

* A long-standing bug in the iSAMS API means that it is not possible fully
  to reconstruct the timetable from the information therein.  Lessons
  taught by form group (tutor groups in Abingdon's case) cannot be linked up
  to the corresponding group without some extra information from outside.
  The way this has been handled in the past was simply to link the lesson to
  the tutor group, but this has led to steadily more problems.

  Lacking a fix from iSAMS (and they have indicated very forcefully that they
  have no intention of fixing it) a better workaround has now been implemented.
  The missing information is now re-constructed and all the missing teaching
  groups (with names like "1M Ma") are generated internally as part of the
  data import process.  They can then be treated as full teaching groups,
  with all the necessary ancillary information.

* The "active" flag in the iSAMS d/b for OH groups seems not to be used.
  All groups have it set to false all the time.  The loader has been enhanced
  to ignore it and instead to a date-based calculation to decide the active
  groups.

* The iSAMS database seems to lack basic integrity checking, in that pupils
  who have left the school can still be listed as members of groups.
  The loader was already correcting this as part of the loading process,
  but because of the sheer quantity, it now doesn't complain about them
  unless the --verbose option is given.

  At a late point in testing, one extra result of this was noticed.  Where
  a pupil has left the school and iSAMS has removed him from the pupil
  lists before removing him from his sets, the loader now copes fine but
  there remains a logic error in the loader - because the student became
  an ex-student *before* leaving his sets it then doesn't remove him from
  his sets on subsequent runs.  The reason for this is fully understood
  and it will be corrected in the next release.  It was too late to add
  it to this one.  The problem is a long-standing one and just hasn't been
  noticed up until now, because it wasn't so easy to check the exact
  membership of groups.

* Eras have acquired a short name, for ease of display in tabs.


v0.6.2  2016-10-21

* Hotfix to fix display of unapproved events.

  Code was added in v0.2 of the software to allow requesters to see
  events in the context of a requested resource even before the
  request was approved.  Users were getting confused by not being
  able to see them.
                   
  Unfortunately this led to a display problem in the case of one very
  edge condition, resulting in an event not being displayed.  This
  release fixes that problem.


v0.6.1  2016-10-12

* Hotfix to restore missing file.

  I accidentally deleted a file in the previous release.  It is used
  solely for fetching data direct from iSAMS's database, so didn't
  show up as missing until this morning's data fetch.

  Now restored from previous commit.


v0.6    2016-10-11

* Add an extra field to OTL's timetable export file.

  OTL requested an extra column on the CSV file of timetable events
  which is auto-generated for him each night.  This contains the
  period number for each event, enabling the whole lot to be sorted
  into chronological order.

* Suppress warning message about invalid student IDs.

  The iSAMS database lacks basic integrity checking for students who
  leave, with the result that they can have left the school but still
  be listed as members of certain groups.  The warning messages for
  teaching groups were suppressed in an earlier release.  This one does
  the same thing for OH groups.


v0.5    2016-10-04

* No code changes at all.

  This release exists solely to test the migration to the new source
  repository - repository.xronos.uk


v0.4    2016-10-02

* Import utility can now set staff records to active

  The importer has always taken a very conservative approach to changing
  the "active" flag on records.  Historically it has set it on
  a best-effort basis, and then never changed.  This has led to one slight
  problem, in that staff get added in an incomplete fashion to iSAMS
  (resulting in a record in Scheduler with active set to false) and then
  don't automatically change when the record is completed.

  This became apparent when Helen K Whitworth was assigned a cover,
  and it turned out she had no timetable in Scheduler because she wasn't
  active.  On investigation, 6 other members of staff (mainly SHSK, or
  peripatetic teachers) were in the same position.
                        
  The method now is to allow the flag to be changed from false to true,
  but never the other way around.

  NEVER change a record's active flag from true to false!


v0.3    2016-09-30

* Suppress a warning message generated by the iSAMS => Scheduler import
  utility when a tutorial involves no teaching staff.

* Add students to the list of resources which can be associated with
  a tutorial.

* Add a new utility - utils/checkrecurring - which can be run after
  changes are made to recurring events in YAML files.  It uses exactly
  the same code as the import utility, but doesn't effect any changes
  and runs in only a few seconds.  It checks for both badly structured
  YAML, and unidentifiable resources.

  As it stands, the utility reports the files which it is checking.
  If the traditional UNIX philosophy of keeping quiet unless something
  goes wrong is preferred, then edit utils/checkrecurring and add --quiet
  to the invocation of the utility.


v0.2    2016-09-28

Changes:

* If a user has a resource selected for display but currently disabled -
  that is the tick-box is unticked - then adding the same resource a
  second time will cause it to be displayed.  This is because when a user
  has a lot of resources selected, he or she may not notice that the
  required one is already there.  The requirement is clearly to show
  it, so show it.

* Reduce notification e-mails.
  The system generates daily e-mails to approvers of resources reminding
  them about pending requests.  When checking for pending requests, the
  system was previously including rejected requests which could lead to
  empty reminder e-mails.  Now only generates e-mails about genuinely
  pending requests.

* Improve display of pending requests.
  Before a request for a resource has been approved, it does not appear
  in the general display for that resource.  Thus, if for instance someone
  has requested that an event be included in the calendar, it doesn't actually
  appear in the calendar until DJD has approved it.  It is however visible,
  greyed out, to DJD and any other approver.

  This led to a bit of confusion, in that the requester too couldn't see it
  in the context of the requested resource.  He or she could see it as
  one of "My events", and in the context of any of the other resources
  used, but not in the context of the one awaiting approval.  Unfortunately,
  some users were turning off all their display except for the requested
  resource and then getting puzzled at not being able to see the event.

  The rule now is: a pending request for a resource will be displayed in
  the context of that resource to:

    Approvers of the resource
    Admin users
    The original requester

* Various chronological development notes have been added in the notes
  directory.



v0.1    2016-09-26

The first release done under the GitFlow convention.  Very many things
happened before this release, but for calibration the last such change
was:

* Dump the entire timetable to a CSV file for analysis by OTL.
